[Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/) is a lightweight toolkit for developing and deploying applications on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).

As Google recently released an [updated version of their Google App Engine SDK](http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/09/app-engine-sdk-125-released-for-python.html), providing support for [XMPP/Jabber messaging](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/xmpp/overview.html) and [Task Queues](http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/taskqueue/overview.html), I've worked on a new Gaelyk version providing support for these new features, with a Groovy touch.

Gaelyk can be downloaded here: [http://gaelyk.appspot.com/download/](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/download/)

You can have a look at the latest [tutorial](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/tutorial/) updated with coverage of:

*   sending / receiving XMPP/Jabber messages,
*   using Task Queues,
*   also an example of how to do queries on the datastore has been added. Read the tutorial here: [http://gaelyk.appspot.com/tutorial/](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/tutorial/)

The [Gaelyk website](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/) uses that new version of Gaelyk, as well as the latest 1.2.5 SDK for Google App Engine. The [Groovy Web Console](http://groovyconsole.appspot.com/) will also be updated shortly to use that new version.

Have fun with Gaelyk!
