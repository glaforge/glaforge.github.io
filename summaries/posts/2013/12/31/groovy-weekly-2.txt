This article, the second "Groovy Weekly" column published on the eve of a new year, serves as a comprehensive roundup of recent developments, releases, articles, presentations, and news within the Groovy ecosystem. The author extends well wishes for a "Groovy year" to the community.

The summary of the article's content is as follows:

**1. Releases:**
The "Releases" section highlights several new and updated projects:

Developed by Victor Vlasenko, it aims to make complex site implementation intuitive and enjoyable. It's suitable for various static websites, from sophisticated company sites to simple blogs, and supports rapid development with on-the-fly changes.
*   **Lazybone Template for Groovy Libraries:** Kunal Dabir created a Lazybone template designed to streamline the creation of Groovy libraries.

*   **CodeNarc Eclipse Plugin 0.20.0:** Following the recent release of CodeNarc 0.20, an associated Eclipse plugin was also released, integrating CodeNarc's static analysis capabilities into the Eclipse IDE.
*   **Gipsy:** Andrés Almiray released Gipsy, an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformation designed to simplify the use of the Service Provider Interface (SPI) in Groovy. This project is similar to his previously created Jipsy annotation processing toolkit for Java.
*   **GroovyLab:** Stergios Papadimitriou shared GroovyLab, an open-source MATLAB-like environment for the Java Virtual Machine, built on the Groovy language.
