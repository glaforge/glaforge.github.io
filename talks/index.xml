Microservices enable reusability, make it easier to change and scale apps on demand but they also introduce new problems. How do microservices interact with each other toward a common goal? How do you figure out what went wrong when a business process composed of several microservices fails? Should there be a central orchestrator controlling all interactions between services or should each service work independently, in a loosely coupled way, and only interact through shared events?</description></item><item><title>Reuse Old Smartphones to Monitor 3D Prints With Webrtc Websockets and Serverless</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/talks/reuse-old-smartphones-to-monitor-3d-prints-with-webrtc-websockets-and-serverless/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 13:59:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/talks/reuse-old-smartphones-to-monitor-3d-prints-with-webrtc-websockets-and-serverless/</guid><description>Reuse old smartphones to monitor 3D prints, with WebRTC, WebSockets and Serverless Monitoring my 3D prints in my basement means climbing lots of stairs back and forth! So here’s my story about how I reused an old smartphone to check the status of my prints. I built a small web app that uses WebRTC to exchange video streams between my broadcasting smartphone and viewers, with WebSockets for signaling, and a serverless platform for easily deploying and hosting my containerized app.</description></item><item><title>Skyrocketing Micronaut Microservices Into Google Cloud</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/talks/skyrocketing-micronaut-microservices-into-google-cloud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 14:27:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/talks/skyrocketing-micronaut-microservices-into-google-cloud/</guid><description>Instead of spending too much time on infrastructure, take advantage of readily available serverless solutions. Focus on your Micronaut code, and deploy it rapidly as a function, an application, or within a container, on Google Cloud Platform, with Cloud Functions, App Engine, or Cloud Run.
In this presentation, you’ll discover the options you have to deploy your Micronaut applications and services on Google Cloud. With Micronaut Launch, it’s easy to get started with a template project, and with a few tweaks, you can then push your code to production.</description></item></channel></rss>
