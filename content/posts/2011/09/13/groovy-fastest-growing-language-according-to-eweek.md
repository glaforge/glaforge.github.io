I've just come across [eWeek's latest article on programming languages](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Groovy-JavaScript-Ruby-Among-Fastest-Growing-Programming-Languages-505803/) trends, and they announce that Groovy is the fastest growing language!

> The data shows the percentage of jobs that have increased (or decreased) for various programming languages since November 2009. In the time frame this slide show depicts, Groovy saw the largest increase in jobs, followed by C# and—surprisingly—COBOL.

Of course, we still have a lot of work to do to continue growing, and stay the most popular and successful alternative language for the JVM, but it's great to see such confirmations on a famous online business journal.
