The SpringOne2GX 2014 conference is over, but you can see below more tweets and presentations from the second part of the conference, and the videos will be available later on on InfoQ.

  

Apart from the excitement around Grails 3, Spring Boot, Groovy, and more, I’d like to highlight the very interesting feedback from Scott Hickey who comes back on 6 years of production usage of Groovy at Mutual of Omaha, saying “Groovy is a phenomenal language for businnes applications”, and that there’s nothing “better” on the JVM! See the first couple of tweets in the Twitter section.
