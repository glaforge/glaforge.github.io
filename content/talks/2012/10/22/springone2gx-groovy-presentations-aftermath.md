Last week, I was in Washington DC for the [SpringOne2GX conference](http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/washington/2012/10/2gx/event_schedule).  

I've had the pleasure of presenting twice: first time on an update on Groovy 2.0 (and a recap on key features of Groovy 1.8), and a second time with my friends and colleagues Paul King (Groovy core committer) and Andrew Eisenberg (Groovy/Grails Eclipse tooling lead) about Domain-Specific Languages in Groovy.
