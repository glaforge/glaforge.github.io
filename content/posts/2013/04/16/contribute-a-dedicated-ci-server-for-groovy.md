The Groovy team is always looking at ways to further improve and encourage the collaboration and contributions from the community.  

Today, the we are** looking for a sponsor for a dedicated server** that would host our **new Continuous Integration server**. If you or your company is interested in helping Groovy by contributing hardware and/or hosting, please contact us.
