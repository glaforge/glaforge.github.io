Here’s the end of a pretty Groovy year coming, giving room for an even groovier one!

I hope you all enjoyed the holidays, and that you’re ready to pour in some more drops of Groovy into your software mixes!

  

Don’t forget to continue [starring the Groovy project on Github](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core), if you haven’t done so, so we try to reach 1000 in the new year!

  

What are going to be your new year’s resolutions? Perhaps some contributions to Groovy’s documentation, some bug fixes or new features?

  

In the meantime, happy reading, here are a few news bits for your consumption!

And let me wish you a very Groovy year!
