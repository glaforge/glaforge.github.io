Time flies, soooo fast! [Griffon](http://griffon.codehaus.org/), the Groovy MVC framework for building desktop applications, is already one year old. Developers know [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and [Grails](http://grails.org/) very well, but there are many other Groovy-based tools and frameworks, and Griffon is a very nice and successful animal of the Groovy ecosystem.

Others are already celebrating this first anniversary on [twitter](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=griffon), as well as in the blogosphere, like some of the Griffon developers:

*   [Jim Shingler](http://jshingler.blogspot.com/2009/09/griffon-celebrates.html)
*   [James Williams](http://jameswilliams.be/blog/entry/155)
*   [Andres Almiray](http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/happy_birthday_griffon)
*   [Josh Reed](http://josh-in-antarctica.blogspot.com/2009/09/happy-birthday-griffon.html)
*   [Danno Ferrin](http://shemnon.com/speling/2009/09/taking-flight-a-year-of-griffo-1.html)

With tons of plugins, books in the writing, Griffon is really gaining a lot of momentum and mindshare!

Happy Birtday! Long live the Griffon!
