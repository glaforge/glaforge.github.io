This article details the author's experience at Devoxx Belgium, where they had the opportunity to meet developers and learn about new technologies. A significant part of the experience involved the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) booth, which hosted interactive codelabs. The author specifically created and ran one of these codelabs, focusing on the deployment of a modern Java microservice application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

The core subject of the codelab, and thus the article, is "deploying a Micronaut application, containerized with Jib, to Google Kubernetes Engine." The author provides a direct link to the codelab for readers who wish to follow along: [g.co/codelabs/micronaut](https://g.co/codelabs/micronaut). For those new to Google Cloud Platform, the article also highlights the availability of a free trial that includes $300 in cloud credits, encouraging hands-on exploration.

The article then introduces the key technologies central to the codelab's process:

1.  **Micronaut:** Described as a modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework. It's designed for building modular, easily testable microservices and serverless applications. Micronaut's key advantages include fast startup times, high throughput, and a minimal memory footprint. Developers can write Micronaut applications using Java, Groovy, or Kotlin.
2.  **Jib:** An open-source tool developed to streamline the process of building Docker and Open Container Initiative (OCI) images specifically for Java applications. It functions as a plugin for popular build tools like Maven and Gradle, and is also available as a Java library, simplifying containerization by removing the need for traditional Dockerfiles.
3.  **Kubernetes:** Presented as an open-source project for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Its versatility allows it to run across various environments, from local laptops to complex, high-availability multi-node clusters, encompassing public clouds, on-premise data centers, virtual machines, and bare metal infrastructure.
4.  **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** This is Google Cloud Platform's managed service offering for Kubernetes. It provides a robust, production-ready environment for deploying and managing containerized applications, abstracting away much of the operational complexity of raw Kubernetes.

The codelab itself guides participants through the practical steps of deploying a simple microservice. Specifically, it uses a Groovy-based Micronaut microservice as the example. The overarching goal is for participants to successfully run their microservice as a replicated service on Kubernetes within the GKE environment. This involves a three-step process: starting with code developed on a local machine, transforming that code into a Docker container image using Jib, and finally, deploying and scaling that image on Google Kubernetes Engine.

In conclusion, the article serves as an introduction to a practical codelab demonstrating a modern, cloud-native workflow. It showcases how to leverage Micronaut for efficient microservice development, Jib for streamlined Java application containerization, and Google Kubernetes Engine for robust, scalable deployment and management in the cloud. The availability of the codelab link and GCP free trial encourages readers to directly engage with these technologies.
