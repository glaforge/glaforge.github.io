This article details a personal account of a significant birthday gift and a subsequent weekend outing that led to a new artistic endeavor.

The narrative begins by establishing the occasion: the author's birthday. For this special event, a person named Stéphanie presented the author with a thoughtful gift aimed at fostering artistic pursuits. The gift consisted of watercolor painting supplies, specifically described as a drawing pad and a comprehensive box containing 16 different watercolor colors. This indicates a complete set, allowing the author to immediately begin exploring the medium.

Following the receipt of this new artistic equipment, the author and Stéphanie decided to make use of the pleasant weather conditions experienced during the weekend. The weather is explicitly characterized as "rather pleasant and mild," which served as the impetus for their plans. They opted for an outdoor activity: a picnic.

The chosen location for this picnic was a particularly iconic and scenic spot: the Grand Canal of the Château de Versailles. This choice of venue not only provided a beautiful backdrop for their outing but also offered an inspiring setting for artistic expression.

During this picturesque picnic at Versailles, the author brought along their newly acquired watercolor gear. It was in this inspiring environment that the author undertook a significant artistic milestone: they created their very first watercolor painting. The article concludes by stating that this initial artwork is presented, implying an accompanying image (as indicated by the placeholder `![](/img/misc/versailles-aquarelle.jpg)`), allowing readers to view the tangible result of this debut artistic endeavor.
