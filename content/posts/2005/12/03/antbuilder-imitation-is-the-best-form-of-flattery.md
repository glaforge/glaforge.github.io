I've just come across a [clone](http://antbuilder.rubyforge.org/) of [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/)'s AntBuilder. It's being built with [JRuby](http://jruby.sourceforge.net/) and allows you to write your build scripts in JRuby by reusing Ant's tasks.

That was a pleasure to see Ruby inspired by our concept of builders, and now, they also copy our own builders. I'd simply say that imitation is the best form of flattery. Kudos guys!
