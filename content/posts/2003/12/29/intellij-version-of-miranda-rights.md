After my suggestion of Miranda as a code name for the upcoming EAP of IntelliJ IDEA, there was a [funny quote from Robert S. Sfeir](http://www.intellij.net/forums/thread.jsp?forum=22&thread=63081#659938) in the forums regarding this suggestion. It's a new version of the Miranda Rights :

> You have the right to refactor. Anything you refactor can be used against you in your code and calls. You have the right to have IDEA present now and during any future refactorings. If you cannot afford an IDEA license, one will be appointed to you, free of charge, during EAP, if you wish.
