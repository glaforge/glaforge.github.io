[Cédric Champeau](https://twitter.com/cedricchampeau), the Groovy core developer working on static type checking and static compilation for Groovy 2, recently gave a very interesting and instructive presentation on this topic at the [Paris Groovy / Grails User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Groovy-Grails/), at the VMware offices.  

You can have a look at his [blog post about the presentation](http://www.jroller.com/melix/entry/static_type_checking_talk_from), including some additional comments regarding the method dispatch logic, some status update and directions.  

And you should also have a look at Cédric's [analysis of the polls](http://www.jroller.com/melix/entry/static_compilation_for_groovy_poll) embedded in the presentation which asked a few questions about people's preferences and expectations with regards to statuc type checking and compilation. Don't hesitate to add your own input, as the poll is not closed and feedback is always welcome.
