This week, coming back from the Devoxx conference in Belgium, I’ve gathered a bag of Groovy news for your consumption, for our usual Tuesday Groovy Weekly release!

  

No particular big highlight today, but perhaps just a happy birthday to GrooScript, the Groovy to JavaScript transpiler, and also notice the opening of the Call for Paper for the GR8Conf conferences in Europe and in the United States.
