The Groovy development team has announced the simultaneous release of three new versions: **Groovy 2.0.1, 1.8.7, and 1.7.11**. This marks a significant moment as it is the first time the team has released three versions concurrently. The core purpose of all three releases is to deliver **bug fixes**, enhancing stability and reliability across different branches of the Groovy ecosystem.

Specifically, the **Groovy 1.8.7** release incorporates many of the bug fixes previously integrated into Groovy 2.0.0, serving as an alignment point with the newer Groovy 2 branch. Looking ahead, the development team confirms that **Groovy 1.8.x and Groovy 2.x branches will be maintained in parallel**, ensuring continued support for both lineages. In contrast, the **Groovy 1.7 branch has officially reached its end-of-life (EOL)** and will no longer receive further maintenance or updates.

Beyond general stability, users may observe notable improvements in performance, particularly when utilizing the "**invoke dynamic**" version of Groovy. Additionally, the Groovy Console on Mac OS X now supports a **full-screen mode**, enhancing the user experience on that platform.

A considerable amount of development effort was directed towards resolving bugs, with particular attention paid to the new features introduced in Groovy 2.0. The **static type checking and static compilation features**, being central to Groovy 2.0's advancements, received the majority of these crucial bug fixes, indicating a strong focus on solidifying these new capabilities.

Regarding **OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative) integration**, the development team has restored the necessary OSGi manifest information within the releases. Users leveraging Groovy within an OSGi container are encouraged to report any remaining quirks or issues to the team, facilitating further refinement. However, a significant **known issue persists concerning the "invoke dynamic" (indy) JARs of Groovy within OSGi environments**. This is not due to Groovy itself, but rather an incompatibility with external tooling: neither the OSGi Gradle plugin nor the underlying bnd library has been updated to correctly handle the "invoke dynamic" bytecode instruction. Consequently, full and proper OSGi support for Groovy's "indy" deliverables will require waiting for subsequent releases of both the OSGi Gradle plugin and the bnd library.

The latest versions of Groovy are available for download from the official Groovy website. Detailed JIRA release notes for Groovy 2.0.1 can be found on a dedicated JIRA page, with release notes for 1.8.7 and 1.7.11 accessible via the main download page.

The Groovy development team expresses profound gratitude to all contributors whose efforts made these releases possible, and thanks the community for its continued attention and support.
