[InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com) is running a reader-driven survey titled "[What's your next JVM language](http://www.infoq.com/research/next-jvm-language)".  

Among the candidates to be ranked, you'll find:

*   Groovy
*   Java 8
*   Ceylon
*   Kotlin
*   Clojure
*   Scala
*   Xtend
*   Fantom
*   Mirah

As well as the languages ported to the JVM like:

*   JRuby
*   Jython
*   Javascript (Rhino and soon Nashorn)
*   Erlang
*   Scheme

The interesting aspect of the survey is that it's not just a mere poll, but you can rank those JVM languages across two criterion: the percentage of lines of code (less or more), and the adoption (like now, in 3 months, in a year). It certainly gives more perspective than a mere poll on your favorite language. The downside might be that it's too easy to rank the ones you dislike negatively without objectivity, but well, polls are like that too :-)  

If you're a Groovy fan like me, be sure to put Groovy in the lower left hand corner ;-)
