The cat is out the bag: I'm joining Google on June 6th, as a **Developer Advocate** for the **Google Cloud Platform** team!

My Groovy friends will likely remember when I launched [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.org/), a lightweight toolkit for developing Groovy apps on Google App Engine? Since then, I've always been a big fan of the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (although it wasn't called that way then) and followed the latest developments of the whole platform. And wohhh, so many new[ services and products](https://cloud.google.com/products/) have seen the light of day since my early experiments with App Engine! So there will be a lot to learn, a lot to do, and thus, a lot to advocate! 

I'm really happy and excited to join the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/) team! I'm looking forward to working with my new team, and join some good old Googler friends I've came to know throughout my career.

I've been really pleased to work with my friends at [Restlet](https://restlet.com/) for the past year and a half, made friends, and learnt a lot along the way working with my colleagues. I wish them luck for their great [Web API platform](https://restlet.com/platform/), and I'll continue to follow their progress!
