Last week, I was in Stockholm, Sweden, for the JFokus conference. [Mattias Karlsson](https://twitter.com/matkar) had invited me to speak about how to benefit from Groovy, how / when / why developers, projects, companies are using and adopting Groovy in their everyday life.  

So I crafted a brand new presentation illustrating those usage patterns, how they are applied, also giving some examples of existing projects or companies benefiting from Groovy in that way.  

I've published the slides on SpeakerDeck, and I'm embedding them below:
