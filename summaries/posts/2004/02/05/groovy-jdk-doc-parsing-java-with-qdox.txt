This article details the development and purpose of a new documentation page on the Groovy website dedicated to "Groovy methods" that enhance core Java Development Kit (JDK) classes. It highlights a significant improvement in Groovy's usability by addressing a prior lack of documentation for these powerful functionalities.

The author introduces these additional methods by providing concrete examples. For instance, the `java.io.File.eachLine()` method allows developers to easily read a text file line by line within a closure, automatically handling the complexities of stream management and closure. Other examples include `Collection.map()` for transforming all objects within a collection and `List.sort()` for simpler, closure-based custom sorting compared to traditional Java comparators.

The central problem highlighted was that despite their utility, these Groovy methods were previously undocumented. This meant that new Groovy users had no official reference and would have had to meticulously examine the source code to discover the full range of available enhancements.

To remedy this, the author proposed to James Strachan the creation of a tool to automatically generate documentation for these methods. Upon Strachan's enthusiastic agreement, the author proceeded to develop this tool, written in Groovy itself.

A key technology leveraged by this documentation generator is QDox, described as a "neat and simple library" created by Joe Walnes. QDox's core function is to parse JavaDoc comments and construct an object graph representing the structure of Java classes, including their fields, methods, and parameters. The article praises QDox for its effectiveness in this task.

The implementation of the tool is encapsulated within a Groovy class named `DocGenerator.groovy`. This class specifically targets the `DefaultGroovyMethods` class, which is the repository for all the Groovy enhancement methods. The `DocGenerator` utilizes a `JavaDocBuilder` from QDox, feeds it the source code of `DefaultGroovyMethods` (via a Reader), extracts all public static methods, and then generates HTML output. This process is characterized as "pretty straightforward and efficient," ultimately producing the `groovy-jdk.html` page that serves as the official documentation.

Looking ahead, the article concludes by outlining future enhancements for the `DocGenerator` tool. Upcoming revisions are planned to implement various output formats, including a framed version designed to offer a JavaDoc-like look and feel. Crucially, an XML version of the documentation will also be generated. This XML output is intended to be a vital data source for the Groovy Eclipse plugin, providing the necessary information to enable advanced features like code-completion for these Groovy-enhanced JDK methods within the IDE.
