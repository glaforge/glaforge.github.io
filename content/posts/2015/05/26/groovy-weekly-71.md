GR8Conf Europe 2015 is literally around the corner, as the conference will start next week in Copenhagen! I’m really excited to be joining the usual flock of Groovy afictionados and talk all things Groovy.

  

Speaking of conferences, lots of new videos and accompanying slide decks have been released, so there are hours of binge watching ahead!

  

By now, I think I can stop reminding you about the move of Groovy from Codehaus to the Apache Software Foundation? (and the move of the mailing-lists, issue tracker, sources, etc.)
