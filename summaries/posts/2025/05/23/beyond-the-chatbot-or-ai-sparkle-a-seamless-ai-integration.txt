The article thoroughly argues against the common perception that chatbots represent the primary, or even sole, effective application of Large Language Models (LLMs). The author observes a pervasive focus on chatbot interfaces in discussions and demonstrations of Generative AI, lamenting that this narrow view overlooks a vast array of more integrated and seamless use cases.

The author provides personal examples to illustrate the diverse applications of LLMs beyond traditional chat interfaces. For instance, LLMs like Gemini and embedding models were leveraged to analyze topic trends and cluster posts from Bluesky without any chatbot interaction. Similarly, when experimenting with generating short science fiction stories, an LLM worked in conjunction with image generation models (like Imagen) to harness their creative capabilities, again without a chat interface. The article also acknowledges LLMs' power in replicating classic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as sentiment analysis or entity extraction, noting that while dedicated predictive models can sometimes be more cost-effective, LLMs offer developers an easy way to implement these functionalities through careful prompting, enabling the addition of seamless features to applications.

The catalyst for the author's perspective was Kojo Osei's article, "there should be no AI button," which criticized the growing trend of "AI sparkle buttons" in applications. The author strongly agrees with Osei, positing that these dedicated AI buttons are a flawed and temporary design choice. They are described as a "quick hack" to imply intelligence, but ultimately add "unnecessary cognitive load," disrupt user focus, and fail to make an application genuinely intuitive or seamlessly smart. Both authors advocate for a user experience where AI is "seamless and integrated," avoiding artificial segregation of AI functionalities and preserving the user's workflow.

The author's core argument is that AI should be built directly into applications, making them inherently smarter and more helpful in a way that feels completely natural to the user. While users should be aware of AI's involvement, the assistance should be smooth and unobtrusive, negating the need for explicit "AI buttons" or opening separate chat windows. Chat interfaces, while valid for specific use cases, are not always the most intuitive or least disruptive. The paramount goal is to keep users in their "flow," augmenting their work with AI rather than breaking it up with extra clicks or messages, which significantly increase cognitive load and hinder focus.

To demonstrate more effective and intuitive AI integration, the article offers several examples of seamless flows:
*   **Conversation Summaries:** In applications like Gmail and Google Chat, AI proactively provides summaries of missed conversations, allowing users to quickly catch up without manually sifting through messages.
*   **Integrated Note-Taking:** Using an Obsidian web clipper configured with Gemini, articles can be automatically summarized into bullet points and tagged, enriching a user's knowledge base without context switching.
*   **LLM-Powered Code Completion:** Tools like Gemini Code Assist provide context-aware code suggestions that appear naturally, often anticipating the developer's intent. If a suggestion is incorrect, it's easily ignored without disrupting the user's typing flow.
*   **AI as a Workflow Peer:** AI can act as a first responder for support tickets, allowing humans to step in once the user details the issue. Similarly, AI coding bots can analyze Pull Requests (PRs) and offer initial improvement recommendations, like the Gemini Code Assist bot on GitHub.
*   **Smart Bug Trackers:** Before creating a ticket, a bug tracker could use LLM-powered or embedding-based semantic search to find similar existing issues, prevent duplicates, or guide the reporter to the correct category.
*   **Draft Generation:** LLMs excel at creating first drafts of various documents, from articles (even parts of the discussed article itself were drafted this way) to customer communications in CRM apps, or guiding image creation from broad artistic strokes.
*   **Contextual AI in Chat Environments:** The author clarifies that in environments *already centered around chat* (like Slack), an AI-powered bot remains highly valuable. Here, the AI acts as an "assistant, a peer, a colleague" that can provide nudges, summaries of past conversations, or relevant information without forcing a context switch.

The article concludes by emphasizing that true AI integration requires UX designers to fundamentally "rethink the app" and leverage the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, rather than resorting to superficial additions. While chatbots have their place for specific tasks like customer support, the ideal AI assistance is a "quiet, helpful partner" that anticipates needs and operates in the background. The ultimate aim is to create AI experiences that boost human productivity and make tools more efficient and insightful without demanding constant context switching or explicit AI intervention via a button or chat message. Successful AI integrations will feel like an inherent, intelligent part of the system, empowering users by working seamlessly, helping them maintain focus, and achieve more rapidly.
