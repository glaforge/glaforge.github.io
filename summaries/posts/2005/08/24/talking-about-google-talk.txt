This article provides a critical, firsthand account of the initial release of Google Talk, focusing on its functionality—or lack thereof—for corporate users and its perceived lack of innovation.

The author immediately raises concerns regarding Google Talk's compatibility with typical corporate network infrastructure. As a "poor corporate user," he highlights the primary challenge of getting the client to work through "nasty proxies (with authentication)" and firewalls, specifically mentioning the need for port 5222 to be opened. Despite personal attempts to tweak proxy settings, he reports these efforts were unsuccessful.

Beyond connectivity issues, the author expresses disappointment with Google Talk's feature set. While acknowledging Google's strong track record with other services, he states that Google Talk offers "not much more than other competitors already provide." He notes a general user expectation for "great features not available anywhere" from Google, which he feels are absent in Google Talk. The only significant integration noted is with GMail, but this is not considered a groundbreaking innovation compared to existing services like Yahoo! Messenger or Skype. The author even points out that Skype also faces challenges working across firewalls.

A significant point of contention is Google's marketing claim, found in their email invitations, that "Google Talk also works across all firewalls." The author explicitly challenges this statement, finding it untrue in his experience. He posits that *if* this claim were truly realized and Google Talk *did* work universally, it would make for an "interesting" and "reliable Jabber server." Furthermore, he sees great potential if Google were to provide a Java API for accessing the client's notification capabilities, envisioning "cool things" like Continuous Integration notifications.

In light of these problems, the author indicates a preference to stick with Yahoo! Messenger, which he describes as "good old and faithful," consistently working "like a charm" in his corporate environment (with one exception where the entire domain was blocked). He openly solicits advice from readers on how to successfully use Google Talk from work.

The article includes two important updates:

*   **Update #1:** Google appears to be aware of the firewall problem. The author received a response from Google acknowledging the issue, stating, "We're aware of the issue, and our engineers are working diligently to find a solution."
*   **Update #2:** The author provides further evidence suggesting the problem lies specifically with the Google Talk client. He notes that other third-party Jabber clients, such as Psi, are able to connect and work "perfectly with Google Talk from work." This observation leads him to conclude that "it really must be the client which's got some problems currently," rather than a fundamental incompatibility of the Jabber protocol itself with his corporate network.

In conclusion, the article initially portrays Google Talk as a promising, yet ultimately underwhelming, release for corporate users due to significant connectivity issues through proxies and firewalls. It criticizes the lack of innovative features compared to competitors and directly refutes Google's marketing claim about universal firewall compatibility. While acknowledging the potential utility if these issues were resolved (particularly regarding its Jabber server capabilities and API access), the author's immediate experience is one of frustration, leading him to rely on alternative services. The updates provide a crucial clarification: Google is aware of the problem, and the specific culprit appears to be the Google Talk client itself.
