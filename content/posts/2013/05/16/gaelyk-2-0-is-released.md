This is with great pleasure that the Gaelyk team announces the **release of Gaelyk 2.0**, the lightweight toolkit for developing applications on Google App Engine with the Groovy dynamic language.  

For the impatient, go directly to the [download page](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/download)!  

It's been long in the making, and there are quite a lot of new features to speak about, like the **migration to Groovy 2.1 and GAE 1.8**, the new **Search DSL**, **improvements to the URL routing system**, various **performance optimizations**, and more.  

Please be sure to have a look at the list of [changes on the release notes section of the download page](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/download). In particular, be sure to have a look at the **breaking changes** which might affect your application when upgrading.  

We're very happy to have Gaelyk 2.0 now officially available in your hands, and we'd like to thank you for your support, for your contributions, and for such a friendly community!  

Enjoy!
