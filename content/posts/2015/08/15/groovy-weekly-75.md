The not-so-weekly Groovy column is back for a summer edition on the shores of the Atlantic ocean (at least, that’s where I am now!) and there was a lot to catch up with in terms of news!

Ratpack is almost at 1.0, only a couple of weeks to go for the mythical release, whereas Gradle arrived in version 2.6, and some updates to the two main Grails lines were out too.

You’ll notice lots of delightful content from GR8Conf US 2015! So many talks to watch (and slides to look at), if you didn’t get a chance to attend the conference.
