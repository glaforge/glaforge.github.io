A significant milestone for the French open source community recently took place in Paris: the inaugural **Open Source Software Get-Together**. The event was organized by Vincent Massol, a well-known figure in the open source world, celebrated for his work on Cactus and as the author of the "JUnit in Action" book.

The author of the article, a Groovy developer and contributor, initially held the perception that few individuals in France were actively involved in Open Source projects. However, this gathering proved that perception incorrect, revealing a vibrant and more numerous community than anticipated. A particularly surprising moment for the author was encountering a colleague from the same company at the event, underscoring the notion of a "small world."

The get-together served as a platform for these French Open Source developers to connect, share experiences, and discuss the various projects they dedicate their free time to. The attendees represented a diverse range of open source initiatives. Notably, almost half of the developers present were contributors to the Apache Maven project, including Vincent Massol himself, Emmanuel Venisse, and Arnaud Heritier. Other prominent projects discussed included EasyStruts, worked on by Emmanuel Boudrant; Twister, developed by Matthieu Riou; JCaptcha, a project of Marc-Antoine Garrigue; and Groovy, to which the author (identified as Guillaume) contributes.

For this initial meeting, Vincent Massol arranged for the group to convene at the headquarters of Pivolis, an innovative "pivotal provider" specializing in offshore development. Following the discussions and networking at Pivolis, the group transitioned to a more informal setting, enjoying a meal at a restaurant situated near the iconic Champs-Elysées. The author highlighted a cultural aspect, noting that "revamping the world while eating and/or drinking is somewhat part of the French culture," suggesting that such communal discussions over food and drink are a cherished tradition in France.

The overall sentiment from the author was one of profound satisfaction and camaraderie, expressing delight at having met the fellow developers and a strong desire for future gatherings, indicating that this first meeting laid the groundwork for subsequent events. The article concludes by inviting readers to view a series of pictures documenting the event, featuring attendees like Marc-Antoine Garrigue, Vincent Massol, Emmanuel Venisse, Arnaud Heritier, Emmanuel Boudrant, Matthieu Riou, and Guillaume (the author).
