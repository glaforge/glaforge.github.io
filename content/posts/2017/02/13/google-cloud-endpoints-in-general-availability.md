Today was [announced the general availability](http://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/02/Google-Cloud-Endpoints-now-GA-a-fast-scalable-API-gateway.html) of [Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/)!

Endpoints is the Google Cloud Platform solution for Web API management, which lets you easily protect & secure your API, monitor it, without overhead, and even allows you to implement your API with any language or framework you want.

I've spoken about Endpoints a few times already, at [Devoxx Belgium]({{< ref "/talks/2016/11/15/binge-streaming-web-apis-with-ratpack-cloud-ednpoints-app-engine-flex-and-streamdata-io" >}}), [Nordic APIs summit]({{< ref "/talks/2016/10/27/scaling-a-swagger-based-web-api-on-google-cloud-endpoints" >}}), and APIDays Paris. And you can see the recording of my Nordic APIs appearance, if you want to learn more about Cloud Endpoints:
