To celebrate the [International Workers' Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Workers'_Day) (a holiday in half of the world's countries, no less! including mine), we're announcing the release of Groovy 2.3.0-RC-4.  

Yes, RC-4 and not RC-3, as we're still having some issues with our build and deployment infrastructure which made us have to skip a bit.  

Thanks to your feedback, we managed to iron out some more issues and regressions we were having with the tricky generics handling.  

You can have a look at the [detailed JIRA release notes](http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=20359) for the issues solved, and [download the latest RC](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download) build at the usual place (or just update the Gradle or Maven dependency coordinates).
