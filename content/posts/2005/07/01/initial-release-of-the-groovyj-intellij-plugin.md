> 
> *   a default Groovy runtime is automatically installed as a global library
> *   Groovy files can be edited with some amount of syntax highlighting
> *   'Run Configurations' can be created for runnable Groovy scripts
> *   Groovy scripts can be run with the output being captured in the embedded console window
> *   Groovy scripts located under module source/test folders will be automatically compiled when compiling modules
