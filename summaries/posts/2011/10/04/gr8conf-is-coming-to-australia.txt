The renowned GR8Conf conference, a prominent international event dedicated to the Groovy ecosystem and its related technologies, has officially announced its expansion to Australia. This significant development was unveiled on the official GR8Conf blog on October 4, 2011.

This inaugural Australian event is scheduled to be held in Canberra on November 15, 2011. Notably, it will run concurrently and side-by-side with the well-established Open Source Developers Conference (OSDC), suggesting a synergistic gathering that will attract a broad audience of open-source enthusiasts and developers interested in the Groovy platform.

To facilitate content for the new conference, the dedicated GR8Conf Australia website (gr8confau.org) has been launched and is actively running a Call for Papers (CFP) process. This presents an open invitation for developers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to submit their proposals for presentations. The scope of topics for submission is broad, encompassing the core Groovy language itself, along with popular frameworks and tools within its ecosystem, such as Grails, Griffon, Gradle, Spock, CodeNarc, and Gaelyk, among others. Presentations can range in nature and depth, from introductory sessions designed to onboard newcomers, to in-depth technical deep dives for experienced users, and practical case studies showcasing real-world applications and solutions.

In essence, GR8Conf is bringing its highly respected platform for knowledge sharing and community building around Groovy technologies to Australia, co-locating with OSDC, and actively seeking submissions from the community to shape its program. This expansion marks a significant step for the GR8Conf series, fostering collaboration and advancing the understanding of Groovy and its associated tools within the Australian developer landscape.
