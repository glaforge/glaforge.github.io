Today I highly recommend you read about the nice [Groovy dedicated support for ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/making-elasticsearch-groovy-er/)! We also have a few interesting dot releases this week. And there’s the scoop that there’s a Ratpack book in the works!

Don’t forget that the Call for Papers for GR8Conf Europe / US and Greach are still open, if you want to speak about your favorite Groovy technologies and experiments!
