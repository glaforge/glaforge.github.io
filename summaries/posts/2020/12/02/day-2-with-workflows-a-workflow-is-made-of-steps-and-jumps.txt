This article serves as a continuation of a series exploring Google Cloud Workflows, building upon a previous introduction to the UI and the creation of a basic "Hello World" workflow. The core focus of this installment is to delve into the fundamental structure and execution flow of workflows, particularly how multiple steps are defined and managed.

At its most basic, a workflow definition is composed of individual **steps**. The article illustrates a simple one-step workflow where a `sayHello` step directly returns a greeting message using the `return` instruction: `return: Hello from Cloud Workflows!`.

When defining a workflow with multiple steps, these are structured sequentially in YAML. By default, Cloud Workflows executes these steps in the order they appear from top to bottom. The execution of a workflow concludes under two main conditions: either when a `return` statement is encountered within any step, explicitly providing a result for the workflow, or when the execution reaches the very last step defined in the workflow. If the workflow completes without an explicit `return` statement, it implicitly returns a `null` value as its result.

Beyond this default linear execution, the article introduces a crucial mechanism for implementing non-sequential logic: the **`next` instruction**. This instruction allows a workflow to explicitly jump from one step to another, regardless of their defined order in the YAML file. The article provides an example where `stepOne` jumps to `stepTwo`, `stepTwo` jumps to `stepThree`, and `stepThree` then jumps to `sayHello`. This demonstrates how `next` can be used to alter the flow of execution, including jumping back and forth between steps, before ultimately reaching a final step that returns a value and terminates the workflow.

The article concludes by hinting at the capabilities that extend beyond simple linear or predefined jump sequences. It states that subsequent articles will explore more advanced control flow mechanisms, such as **conditional jumps** and **switches**, which are essential for building more complex and dynamic logic within workflows. Furthermore, future discussions will cover how to **pass data and values between steps**, enabling more sophisticated inter-step communication and processing. This current article, therefore, lays the foundational understanding of defining, ordering, and explicitly controlling the sequence of steps in Google Cloud Workflows.
