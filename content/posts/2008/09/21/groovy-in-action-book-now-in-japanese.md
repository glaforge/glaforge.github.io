But not only has it been translated, but it has also been improved and covers Groovy 1.5.6 and contains fixes to all the errata of the original version.

Here's the announcement from Dierk:

> I'm very happy to announce that the japanese edition of "Groovy in Action" has just hit the shelves.
>
> Please visit the [publisher's page](http://book.mycom.co.jp/book/978-4-8399-2727-1/978-4-8399-2727-1.shtml) or [on Amazon Japan](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4839927278/).
>
> Kazuchika Sekiya and his five friends did an awesome job in not only translating the book "as is" but also updating it to the latest Groovy version (1.5.6), adapting all listings and explanations. Furthermore, they went through all known errata of the original version.
>
> Above all, they did not blindly translate word-by-word but challened the meaning of every sentence, asked for clarification, and came up with improved wordings that avoid any kind of ambiguity.
>
> It should not be left unmentioned that the translators work for Sun Microsystems Japan in their day job but did all that hard work in their spare time.
>
> I'm very thankful for the experience of having seen this translation develop and now seeing the grace of the final result. Let's spread the word about Groovy!
>
> Thank you, guys - domo arigato gozaimasu!
