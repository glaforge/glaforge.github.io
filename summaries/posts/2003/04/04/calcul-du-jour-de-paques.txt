This article details the surprising complexity involved in the seemingly simple task of integrating public holidays into a shared calendar feature for an application called "OpenProspect." The author embarks on this task, initially assuming it would be straightforward, but quickly discovers that the reality is far more intricate than anticipated.

The primary argument of the article is that calculating and displaying public holidays is not a simple matter. It begins by illustrating this complexity using France as an example. Even within a single country, holidays are not all fixed dates. There are "fixed days" (like New Year's Day or Christmas) and "mobile days." The most significant mobile holiday mentioned is Easter ("Pâques"), which requires a complex calculation to determine its date each year. Crucially, other important public holidays, such as Ascension Thursday ("jeudi de l'Ascension") and Whit Monday ("lundi de Pentecôte"), are directly dependent on and calculated relative to the date of Easter, adding a layer of computational difficulty.

The article then highlights that the challenge escalates significantly when considering an international scope. Beyond France, public holidays are not uniform across different countries. More importantly, the complexity further deepens because, in some nations, public holidays are not even consistent nationwide; they vary by region or state. The United States is specifically cited as an example where certain public holidays are unique to a particular state, meaning a global calendar would need to account for sub-national variations.

Given these challenges, the author acknowledges the difficulty and points to useful resources discovered during their research. Two specific examples are provided:
1.  An "excellent site" ([http://www.jours-feries.com/](http://www.jours-feries.com/)) that offers calculations for *all* public holidays in a large number of countries. This suggests a pre-existing solution for the core calculation challenge.
2.  A JavaScript calculation for the date of Easter ([http://www.bdl.fr/minitel/calendrier/date_paques.html](http://www.bdl.fr/minitel/calendrier/date_paques.html)), emphasizing that developers might need to delve into source code to understand or implement such calculations.

The article concludes by reiterating that the goal of displaying all public holidays on a calendar is a far more arduous and involved process than it initially appears. The author uses the colloquial French expression "on n'est pas sorti de la veille," implying that it's a long way from being finished or simple, and ends with "Bon courage!" (Good luck!), underscoring the considerable effort and problem-solving required for such an endeavor. The core conclusion is that what seems like a minor feature can become a significant technical hurdle due to the varied and complex nature of international and regional public holiday systems.
