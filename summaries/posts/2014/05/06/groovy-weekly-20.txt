    *   Using the `@Sortable` annotation to make classes `Comparable`.
    *   New methods for NIO Path.
    *   Achieving more efficient tail recursion with the `@TailRecursive` annotation.
    *   Employing `@BaseScript` with an abstract `run` script method.
    *   Extensive coverage of the new **`@Builder` AST transformation** for creating fluent APIs, including definitions with extra type checks and its application to other classes.
*   **General Groovy Goodness:** Other articles in the series explored checking configuration properties in `ConfigObject` and extending `ConfigSlurper` with custom environments.
*   **Grails Goodness:** MrHaki also contributed to Grails, with an article on using aliases as command shortcuts.
*   **Grails-Specific Articles:** A series of articles focused on various aspects of Grails development, such as multi-factor authentication, GORM bulk delete, implementing many-to-many relations with MongoDB, tracking Hibernate statistics, social authentication, Spring Security permission-based frameworks, debugging in IntelliJ IDEA, and Facebook OAuth for fetching page tokens.
*   **Miscellaneous Groovy Articles:** Topics included getting SVN information using Groovy, a Groovy implementation of the INI file format (part 2), and effective database resource handling in Groovy.

**Social Media Buzz and Code Snippets:**

*   **Tweets** highlighted Groovy 2.3.0's availability via GVM, changes in `groovysh` commands, an upcoming Groovy podcast, and the positive impact of Groovy 2.3's reworked generics handling on uncovering bugs in the old type checker (while also requesting regression reports). Community tips like using the `#groovylang` hashtag were also shared.
*   **Google+ posts** included an announcement for a new version of the Gradle Android plugin.
*   **Code Snippets** showcased practical examples, such as variants of Gaussian distribution with Java 8, Groovy, and GPars, metaprogramming additions to Java 8's `LocalDate` for Groovy's `+ days` functionality, and detailed examples of the new `@Builder` transformation's implementation strategies.
