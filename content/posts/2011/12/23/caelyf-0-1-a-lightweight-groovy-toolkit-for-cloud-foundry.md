I'm very happy to announce the release of [Caelyf](http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com) 0.1, a lightweight Groovy toolkit for Cloud Foundry.  

Caelyf is inspired by the [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com) project, and actually borrows most of its code base. Its goal is to let you write apps using Groovy scripts and templates, and then deploy them on the Cloud Foundry platform.  

Caelyf is Open Source, released under the Apache 2 license.  

Its source code is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/glaforge/caelyf](https://github.com/glaforge/caelyf) Which means you will also be able to use the issue tracker from GitHub to file bugs or feature requests. And of course, if you want to contribute to the project, you're just one pull request away!  

We're using [Google groups](https://groups.google.com/group/caelyf) for interacting with our upcoming users.  

Caelyf is obviously very young (ie. that's its first release), so it might be rough around the edges, and I'd appreciate if you provide me with some feedback as you delve into the project and deploy your first applications.  

As a proof of concept, the first application written with Caelyf is the Caelyf website itself: [http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com](http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com) It's always great to be able to eat one's own dog food!  

On the [Caelyf website](http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com), you'll find a [detailed tutorial](http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com/tutorial) explaining what you can do with the framework, and how to use it. I haven't included the steps to get setup on Cloud Foundry, but you'll find the link to the Cloud Foundry documentation for that purpose.  

You will also find the links for downloading a template project, or just a JAR if you prefer that: [http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com/download](http://caelyf.cloudfoundry.com/download)  

Well, that's pretty much it, so, have fun, tell me what your experience is, and Merry Christmas :-)
