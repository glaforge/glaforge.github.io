If you want to learn everything about Groovy and Grails, get in touch with all the projects committers and contributors, and have a great time, you should definitely not miss the [Groovy / Grails Experience](http://www.groovygrails.com/gg/2gexperience) that will take place in Reston, VA, USA -- February 21 - 23, 2008

There's a pretty impressive [list of speakers](http://www.groovygrails.com/gg/conference/speakers?showId=131), and the [session schedule](http://www.groovygrails.com/gg/conference/schedule?showId=131) looks pretty tasty. It's the best opportunity to get the right information straight from the horse's mouth. A lot of topics will be covered, ranging from introductions to Groovy / Grails up to more advanced topics like DSLs, design patterns in dynamic languages, Java integration, Swing UIs, GORM, and more.

The conference is on February 21st-23rd, so there's not much time left to get ready and register. But courtesy of [G2One](http://www.g2one.com/), the Groovy/Grails professional services company, and NFJS, if you register with the promo code **2gx2008g2one**, you'll even get a **$150 discount**!

Groovy and Grails have recently been coined as the technologies to learn in 2008, this conference will help you get started.
