No need to be a Python developer to do Generative AI!
If you're a Java developer, you can take advantage of [LangChain4j](https://docs.langchain4j.dev/)
to implement some advanced LLM integrations in your Java applications.
And if you're interested in using
[Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/),
one of the best models available, I invite you to have a look at the following "codelab" that I worked on:

[Codelab â€” Gemini for Java Developers using LangChain4j](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/gemini-java-developers)

In this workshop, you'll find various examples covering the following use cases, in _crescendo_ approach:

- Making your fist call to Gemini (streaming & non-streaming)
- Maintaining a conversation
- Taking advantage of multimodality by analysing images with your prompts
- Extracting structured information from unstructured text
- Using prompt templates
- Doing text classification with few-shot prompting
- Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation to chat with your documentation
- How to do Function Calling to expand the LLM to interact with external APIs and services

You'll find all the [code samples on Github](https://github.com/glaforge/gemini-workshop-for-java-developers).

If you're attending Devoxx France, be sure to attend the
[Hands-on-Lab workshop](https://www.devoxx.fr/en/schedule/talk/?id=40285) with my colleagues
[Mete Atamel](https://twitter.com/meteatamel) and [Valentin Deleplace](https://twitter.com/val_deleplace)
who will guide you through this codelab.
