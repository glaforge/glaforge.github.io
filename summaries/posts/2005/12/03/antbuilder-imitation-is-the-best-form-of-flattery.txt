The article details the author's discovery of a new software project: a clone of Groovy's AntBuilder, which is being developed using JRuby. This new project, accessible at `antbuilder.rubyforge.org`, allows developers to write their build scripts in JRuby, effectively reusing the existing and extensive set of Ant tasks.

The author expresses significant pleasure and enthusiasm upon encountering this development. They highlight that the Ruby community, specifically through JRuby, has been inspired by Groovy's innovative concept of "builders." The author notes that this inspiration has now progressed to the point where Ruby developers are directly "copying" or reimplementing Groovy's own specific builders, citing the AntBuilder as a prime example.

From the author's perspective, this act of imitation is not seen as a negative, but rather as the highest form of compliment or "flattery." This indicates a strong belief in the originality and utility of Groovy's builder concept. The article concludes with a positive affirmation, extending "Kudos" to the developers behind the JRuby AntBuilder project, acknowledging their work as a testament to the influence and success of Groovy's design patterns. In essence, the article celebrates the cross-pollination of ideas between programming communities, viewing the adoption of Groovy's builder paradigm in JRuby as a validation of its architectural elegance and effectiveness.
