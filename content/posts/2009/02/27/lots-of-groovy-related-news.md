There's always a lot of activity around Groovy and Groovy-related technologies, but these days, it's pretty hot!

First of all, InfoQ released my "[What's new in Groovy 1.6?](http://www.infoq.com/articles/groovy-1-6)" article going in depth into all the new features of Groovy 1.6, with explanations and code samples. Please [vote for it on DZone](http://www.dzone.com/links/whats_new_in_groovy_16_detailed_article_on_infoq.html) (Guerilla Marketing rulezzz)

If you want to attend a [Groovy / Grails / Griffon dedicated conference](http://www.gr8conf.org/), you should definitely go to the GR8 Conference, in Copenhagen, Denmark, in May. It's going to rock, with star speakers, hands-on sessions, several interesting benefits in the attendee package, and more. Check it out!

And to finish, there are tons of releases:

*   [Groovy 1.6](http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=263)
*   [GMaven 1.0-rc-5: Groovy Maven plugin](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2009/02/27/GMaven+1.0-rc-5+released)
*   [Griffon 0.1-rc2](http://groovy.dzone.com/announcements/griffon-01-rc2-builds)
*   [Grails 1.1 RC2](http://grails.org/news/14369)

And if you've got some artistic talent or if you know some talented designers, the [Griffon team is still looking for a logo](http://griffon.codehaus.org/Logo+Contest)!
