The Groovy team is happy to announce the **releases of the second beta of Groovy 2.2**, along with a **bug fix release of Groovy 2.1.7**.

We're close to moving towards RC mode for the upcoming Groovy 2.2 release, and we'd be happy to **hear about your feedback about this new version** when used in your projects. Please have a moment to test it against your code, and tell us if you notice any problem or regression.

Groovy 2.2.0-beta-2 is pretty much feature complete by now, with only a few minor improvements, and both 2.2.0-beta-2 and 2.1.7 contain a great deal of bug fixes around our static type checker and compilation support.

You can have a look at the JIRA release notes for the details:

*   [Groovy 2.1.7](http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=19430)
*   [Groovy 2.2.0-beta-2](http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=19431)

Those two Groovy versions are available in the [download area](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download) of the website.

Thanks a lot to all those who contributed to this release, and we're looking forward to hearing your feedback about the upcoming 2.2!

We'd also be happy to see you at next week's [SpringOne2GX conference](http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/santa_clara/2013/09/register) if you're around! So don't hesitate to come and say hi to the Groovy team members who will be present â€” and there are quite a few of us there!
