![](http://www.eu2011.gr8conf.org/a/125x125_banner_animated.gif)It is this time of the year: [GR8Conf Europe 2011](http://gr8conf.eu/) is ready to rock the Groovy world!

[Register now](http://www.eu2011.gr8conf.org/register) to **save €300** with the Early Bird rate!

Three days packed with **Groovy, Grails, Griffon, Gradle, Spock, GPars, Gaelyk, AST transformations, GContracts, Grails Plugins development**, and lots of other gr8 stuff.

This year, the **conference is growing**. We kick of the conference with a **university day**, with two tracks, one intermediate and one advanced, with workshops and hands-on training:

*   The intermediate will kickstart your Groovy and Grails development skills with a **Groovy workshop**, followed by a **Grails workshop**.
*   The advanced track will feature an **AST transformations workshop**, followed by a **Grails plugin development workshop**.

Note: The university day is optional, if you only want to attende the two main conference days.

The [conference agenda](http://www.eu2011.gr8conf.org/agenda/list) will feature updates from Groovy, Grails, Griffon, Gradle, Spock and others, by the founders and developers of these tools and frameworks.

**You will learn all about those groovy-powered project of the ecosystem from the horse’s mouth**. If you want to meet and chat with guys like Guillaume Laforge, Jochen “blackdrag” Theodorou, Paul King, Dierk König and Hamlet D’Arcy (Groovy), like Andres Almiray (Griffon), like Peter Ledbrook and Burt Beckwith (Grails), like Peter Niederwieser (Gradle and Spock), or Václav Pech (GPars), and many more, this is the best opportunity for you to interact with the gang!

There will be **case studies** from various companies, telling about **real life projects**, and there will be lots of sessions covering various topics in the Groovy ecosystem. To cram this in to two days, the conference is going to be **two-tracked**, compared to the previous editions.

To top it off, we feature [Hackergarten](http://hackergarten.net/) — an open event, where you can come and hack your favorite Open Source project. You can attend even if you are not a conference attendee!

The conference takes place in **Copenhagen**, Denmark, on **May 17th-19th**.

You can benefit from the interesting **Early Bird** rate until **April 14th** and **save €300**! That’s a bargain you shouldn’t miss!
