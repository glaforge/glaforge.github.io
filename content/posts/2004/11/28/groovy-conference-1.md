So far, I didn't blog about our first ever Groovy Conference we held on November 11th and November 12th. But at least, here are some pictures taken there. I've created a [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) account and put [my pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/72768689@N00/tags/groovy/) son it.

Jeremy Rayner [blogged](http://web1.2020media.com/j/jez/javanicuscom/blog2/items/165-index.html) about the conference, and also took [some pictures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jez/tags/groovy/), and wrote down a [few notes](http://javanicus.com/blog2/items/166-index.html) about the conference.
