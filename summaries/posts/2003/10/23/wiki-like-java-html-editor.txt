The article describes a developer's ongoing work on a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool, which is a classic Swing application built upon an existing framework. The author focuses on a particular "fun" and "interesting" aspect of this development: the creation of an innovative, integrated help system.

Initially, a standard contextual help system was implemented. This system allows users to select any component within the GUI – such as a tabbed pane or a node in a JTree – and instantly view the corresponding help page in a separate, user-configurable frame. These help pages are rendered as HTML using a `JEditorPane` with an `HTMLEditorKit`.

The truly innovative component, however, is a custom-developed "wiki-like system" for creating and managing the content of these HTML help pages. The author highlights that a common challenge in development teams is a reluctance to write documentation. This wiki system directly addresses that by making documentation creation seamless and intuitive. Developers can simply activate an "edit checkbox" to switch to a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing mode. In this mode, they can easily create headings, paragraphs, apply styles, generate lists, insert images, and establish links between different help pages. A particularly useful feature is the ability to create a link to either an existing page or "automagically" generate a new page on the fly when setting up a link, streamlining the page creation process. This integrated system effectively allows for the creation, editing, and viewing of HTML help pages directly within the RAD application itself.

Beyond internal documentation, the author also discusses a further innovative idea: enabling final users of the application to interact with the help system by appending their own user-defined comments to help pages. The author suggests this capability to allow users to contribute or even edit the help system themselves is a unique and forward-thinking concept.

Looking to the future, the author expresses an intention to potentially adapt this wiki-like editing system into an IntelliJ IDEA plugin. The purpose of such a plugin would be to allow developers to easily edit simple HTML pages for their own development-related documentation.

The article concludes by promising a future post that will provide a playable version or more tangible demonstration of the described system, encouraging readers to "stay tuned."
