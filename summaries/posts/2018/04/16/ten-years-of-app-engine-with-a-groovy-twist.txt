This article serves as a commemorative piece for Google App Engine's (GAE) 10th anniversary, reflecting on its journey since its launch in 2008. The author, a self-professed long-time fan, recounts his extensive personal and professional history with the platform, highlighting his consistent reliance on GAE for his projects.

Initially launched with Python as its first runtime, GAE captured the author's interest significantly with the release of its Java runtime the following year in 2009. He emphasizes his role as a "fan of App Engine, since the beginning" and considers it his "go-to platform" for deploying ideas to the cloud. Over the years, he has built several applications running on GAE, including his current blog, a personal picture/video sharing app, a GitHub post-commit webhook for the Apache Groovy project, and the Groovy Web Console, which allows users to share, edit, and run Groovy scripts in the cloud.

The author praises App Engine for its core philosophy: enabling developers to "focus on the idea I want to implement, rather than thinking upfront about infrastructure, provisioning, ops, etc." He credits GAE as a pioneer in Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and a precursor to the modern "Serverless" computing approach.

Regarding GAE's pricing, the author acknowledges having previously "ranted" about pricing changes in 2011, but notes that these experiences ultimately led him to optimize his own applications and code. He finds GAE's "pay-as-you-go" model appealing, as most of his applications run within the free tier. He recalls only spending a few dollars on rare occasions of "big peaks of traffic and users," during which App Engine transparently scaled his applications automatically without any intervention on his part, alleviating the need to manage infrastructure.

A significant part of the author's personal story with App Engine involves his direct collaboration with Google. In 2009, prior to the Java runtime's official launch, he was contacted by Google, via his friend Dick Wall, to work with the engineering team responsible for the upcoming runtime. The goal was to ensure that alternative languages, specifically Apache Groovy, would perform effectively on the platform. This involved working hand-in-hand with Google engineers to patch Groovy, making it more compliant with App Engine's then-existing sandboxing mechanisms (limitations which, he notes, have since been lifted in newer runtimes). This integration work led to a significant opportunity for him to present at Google I/O 2009, showcasing Groovy and Grails running on App Engine. Furthermore, his work on this integration inspired him to develop the Gaelyk framework, a reusable library of convenient Groovy shortcuts tailored specifically for App Engine.

The article concludes with the author expressing deep gratitude and offering congratulations and "happy anniversary" wishes to various Google colleagues and collaborators, including Max Ross, Toby Reyelts, Don Schwartz, Dick Wall, Patrick Chanezon, Christian Schalk, Ludovic Champenois, Éamonn McManus, and Roberto Chinnici, for their contributions to the platform. He also notes his current role, having joined Google Cloud Platform almost two years prior (at the time of writing) as a Developer Advocate, and expresses his eagerness to further explore and cover the serverless domain.
