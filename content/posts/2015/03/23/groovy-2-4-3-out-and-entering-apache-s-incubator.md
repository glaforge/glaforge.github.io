The Groovy team is happy to announce another 2.4 release, with Groovy 2.4.3.

We noticed some regressions that needed our attention, and we decided to release rapidly after our recent 2.4.2 release of last week. Please upgrade to 2.4.3 if you're on the 2.4.x line.

You can read about the tickets resolved in our changelog: [http://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-2.4.3.html](http://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-2.4.3.html)

And you can download the [Groovy distribution](http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html) as usual on the new Groovy website.

I'd also like to announce that Groovy [passed the vote to enter the Apache Software Foundation Incubator](http://markmail.org/message/uaickpdsffd4gnzu)! In the coming weeks, we'll be through the incubation process, likely for a few months, where we'll be moving things around (sources, JIRA, mailing-lists, etc), so you can expect a bit of change, but we'll keep you posted on how we progress along.
