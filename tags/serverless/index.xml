So here’s my story about how I reused an old smartphone to check the status of my prints. I built a small web app that uses WebRTC to exchange video streams between my broadcasting smartphone and viewers, with WebSockets for signaling, and a serverless platform for easily deploying and hosting my containerized app.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Website Changes with Workflows Cloud Functions and Sendgrid</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/monitoring-website-change-wwith-workflows-cloud-functions-and-sendgrid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 15:53:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/monitoring-website-change-wwith-workflows-cloud-functions-and-sendgrid/</guid><description>Every year in France, around mid-September, there&amp;rsquo;s a special weekend where everyone can visit some famous places, usually closed the rest of the year.

Focus on your Micronaut code, and deploy it rapidly as a function, an application, or within a container, on Google Cloud Platform, with Cloud Functions, App Engine, or Cloud Run.
In this presentation, you’ll discover the options you have to deploy your Micronaut applications and services on Google Cloud. With Micronaut Launch, it’s easy to get started with a template project, and with a few tweaks, you can then push your code to production.</description></item></channel></rss>
