It's a bit of a late notice, but if you're in Paris these days, you may wish to come to the Paris JUG tomorrow night (Tuesday, September 9th). I'll be presenting an introduction to [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) (the dynamic language for the JVM), as well as a presentation on [Grails](http://grails.org/) (the agile and productive web application framework) with the help of my friend and former colleague [Fabrice Robini](http://blog.octo.com/index.php/2008/09/08/138-paris-jug-groovy-et-grails).

You can register [here](http://jugevents.jugpadova.it/jugevents/event/registration.form?event.id=7939) and get more information about the [agenda](http://www.parisjug.org/xwiki/bin/view/Meeting/20080909) of that Paris JUG night.

See you all tomorrow evening!
