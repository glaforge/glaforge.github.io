The Groovy development team has officially announced the release of Groovy 2.0, marking a significant milestone for the highly popular dynamic language designed for the Java platform. This major update introduces a suite of new features and enhancements aimed at improving code quality, performance, modularity, and integration with the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) capabilities.

A primary highlight of Groovy 2.0 is the introduction of a **static type checker**. This new functionality empowers the compiler to analyze Groovy code and provide feedback on its correctness, allowing developers to catch potential errors earlier in the development cycle and enhance code reliability. Complementing this, the release also brings **static compilation**, a crucial addition that enables developers to compile critical sections of their applications statically. This feature is specifically designed to boost the performance of these particular parts of an application where execution speed is a key concern.

Another significant advancement in Groovy 2.0 is its enhanced **modularity**. The traditional, monolithic Groovy JAR has been re-architected and split into smaller, more focused feature-oriented JARs. This change offers greater flexibility, allowing users to include only the specific components they need, thereby reducing dependency footprints. Furthermore, this modular design also enables developers to create their own custom extension modules, fostering greater extensibility and customization within the Groovy ecosystem.

To maintain close compatibility and synergy with its Java counterpart, Groovy 2.0 incorporates **JDK 7 Project Coin syntax enhancements**. This ensures that Groovy remains as user-friendly and familiar as possible for developers accustomed to Java's modern syntax improvements. Additionally, Groovy 2.0 integrates **JDK 7 Invoke Dynamic**, a powerful feature that allows the language to benefit directly from the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM)'s optimized support for dynamic languages, potentially leading to improved runtime performance and efficiency.

For users and developers seeking more detailed information on these new features and other aspects of Groovy 2.0, the announcement directs them to a comprehensive article on InfoQ, authored by Guillaume Laforge, who also issued this release announcement on behalf of the Groovy team. The official Groovy website's download area is provided for those wishing to download Groovy 2.0. Additionally, a JIRA changelog is made available, offering a detailed overview of all the issues fixed in this release, as well as information regarding the various beta and release candidate stages that preceded the final Groovy 2.0 launch.

The Groovy development team concluded the announcement by expressing its sincere gratitude to its extensive community. This includes all the users, contributors, and committers whose invaluable feedback, unwavering support, and dedicated contributions were instrumental in bringing this important Groovy 2.0 release to fruition. The announcement was signed off by Guillaume Laforge, representing the entire Groovy team.
