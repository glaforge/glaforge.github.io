This article announces the launch of InfoQ, a new community news site founded by Floyd Marinescu, previously known for establishing TheServerSide.com. InfoQ is described as a "community of communities" designed to deliver a rich array of content including news, articles, interviews, presentations, opinions, and even mini-books. Its primary target audience comprises software and technical architects, project leads, and managers.

Upon its "unleash/unlaunch," InfoQ features five main communities or topics: Java, .Net, Ruby, SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), and Agile. A key advantage of this community-based structure is the ease with which users can subscribe to or browse only the content relevant to their specific interests. The quality of these communities is highlighted by the involvement of well-known and respected contributors, such as Scott Ambler for the Agile section and Obie Fernandez for the Ruby part.

Beyond the main topics, InfoQ offers further personalization through the selection of specific sub-topics or tags like Architecture, Modeling, and Domain-Specific Languages. This is characterized as an "orthogonal clustering of information," allowing for detailed content filtering. The site also incorporates "Web 2.0" features, notably extensive use of AJAX, which the author notes is implemented for practical benefits rather than just trendy aesthetics.

The author provides a personal connection to InfoQ, mentioning that Floyd Marinescu recorded his presentation on "Simplifying Enterprise Development with Groovy" during JavaOne 2006, which is expected to be published on the site in the future. The article also cites an existing InfoQ news entry about Oracle's decision to contribute to the development of Grails and Groovy as an example of the timely and relevant content the site offers.

Concluding, the author extends good luck to Floyd Marinescu for this new venture and pledges to be a faithful reader. As a Software Architect at OCTO Technology, a consulting company specializing in architecture, the author expresses that InfoQ is precisely the kind of resource he had been seeking in his professional life.
