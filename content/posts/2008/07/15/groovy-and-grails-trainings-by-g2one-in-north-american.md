If you're in the **North America** and you want to get up to speed with Groovy and Grails, [G2One](http://www.g2one.com/), the Groovy/Grails company, has just announced its [updated training schedule](http://www.g2one.com/training/) for this year.

From August to November, we'll be in:

*   San Jose (CA)
*   Chicago (IL)
*   Orange County (CA)
*   Austin (TX)
*   Calgary (Canada)
*   and Atlanta (GA)

You can find the [exact dates online](http://www.g2one.com/training/). And you can already register for the [San Jose](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=163134) and [Chicago](http://www.acteva.com/booking.cfm?bevaid=163135) dates in August.

These public trainings are the ideal opportunity to learn those technologies by listening to the guys who actually provide them: you learn Groovy and Grails right from the horse mouth! No other horses like us understand Groovy and Grails better! Also, with a nice mix of lecture and hands-on labs, there's no doubt you'll become an expert soon.
