This is this time of the year where all the Groovy hackers and fans are meeting together in Denmark, Copenhagen, for the [GR8Conf conference](http://gr8conf.eu/). A conference dedicated to [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org), Grails, Gradle, Griffon, Spock, GPars and all the Groovy ecosystem. If you're interested in these technologies or are already using them, this is the opportunity you shouldn't miss.  

Also, you're pretty lucky, because I have a ticket for half the price to offer you! But there's just one seat I can offer at that price. So if you're interested, please add a nice comment to this post, that may be fun, or explaining why you'd like to come, and in a few weeks, I'll tell you who deserves to win this prize!  

Ready, Steady, Groovy!
