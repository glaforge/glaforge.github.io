The article details the author's decision to undertake a comprehensive modernization of their personal blog platform. The primary objective is to "reboot" an existing, older blog, transitioning it from its previous technological foundation to a more contemporary and robust stack.

Previously, the blog was implemented using PHP. The author expresses a clear intent to move away from this older setup, explicitly stating the motivation to "move to the next millenium." This phrase signifies a desire for a significant technological upgrade, aiming for a more modern, efficient, or perhaps more maintainable and scalable solution compared to the previous PHP-based incarnation.

For the revamped blog engine, the author has chosen a specific and integrated set of technologies. The core of the new blog engine will be developed using **Groovy**, a dynamic language for the Java platform. This indicates a shift towards a language known for its conciseness and scripting capabilities, while still benefiting from the extensive Java ecosystem.

To aid in the development of this Groovy-based engine, the author will be utilizing **Gaelyk**. Gaelyk is specifically highlighted as a "lightweight toolkit," suggesting a preference for a lean and efficient framework that simplifies development, particularly within the chosen ecosystem. Its design likely focuses on minimizing overhead and accelerating the development process.

Finally, the entire modernized blog application is slated for deployment on **Google App Engine**. This choice of platform indicates a move towards cloud-based infrastructure, which typically offers benefits such as automatic scaling, managed services, and simplified operational aspects, aligning with the author's aspiration to adopt "next millenium" technologies for their blog.
