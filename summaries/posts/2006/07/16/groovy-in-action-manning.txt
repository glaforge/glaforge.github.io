The blog post provides a detailed look at the upcoming book "Groovy in Action," published by Manning, and shares key information about its authorship, content, and endorsements. The author of the blog post is also a contributing author to the book and mentions having initially forgotten to showcase the book's cover while blogging about the latest Groovy and Grails news.

"Groovy in Action" is primarily written by Dierk Koenig, with significant assistance from Andrew Glover, Paul King, Jon Skeet, and the blog post's author. A particularly notable endorsement comes from James Gosling, the creator of Java, who not only wrote the foreword for the book but also personally expressed his strong positive opinion to the blogger at JavaDay 2006, stating that he had used Groovy in several projects at Sun and liked it very much.

The article provides the book's abstract, which outlines its comprehensive scope and objectives. "Groovy in Action" is described as a thorough description of the Groovy programming language, its associated libraries, and its practical everyday applications. It highlights Groovy's significant status as the second standard language for the Java platform, established with the release of JSR 241. The book aims to introduce Java developers to the new dynamic features that Groovy integrates into the platform.

The book's content is structured into distinct parts to cater to various aspects of Groovy development:
*   **The first part** of the book is dedicated to explaining the fundamental components of Groovy, covering essential topics such as datatypes, control flow mechanisms, the object model, and specifics of handling various operations.
*   **The second part** elaborates on the enhancements that Groovy brings to standard Java development. This includes an exploration of builders and template engines, improvements to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) through the Groovy Development Kit (GDK), various integration options, and specialized support for working with XML, regular expressions, and database programming.
*   A dedicated **"hands-on experience" part** of the book offers practical advice, tips, and tricks for daily programming work. It also covers crucial development practices such as unit testing, provides insights into build support, and even demonstrates how to script Windows environments effectively using Groovy.
*   An **"additional bonus track"** is included, which focuses specifically on Grails, identified as the Groovy Web Application Framework.

The book's pedagogical approach emphasizes learning by example, presenting numerous reusable code snippets while simultaneously explaining the underlying conceptual principles. It is designed to facilitate a smooth transition for Java developers new to the dynamic programming world, while also offering new perspectives, triggers for creativity, and serving as a solid reference for experienced Groovy experts.

While only the initial chapters of "Groovy in Action" are currently available through the Early Access Program (MEAP), interested individuals can gain a full understanding of the book's detailed structure as Dierk Koenig has provided the complete table of contents on the Groovy mailing lists.
