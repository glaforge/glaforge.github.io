At [Voxxed Days Microservices](https://voxxeddays.com/microservices/), in Paris, 
I talked about the latest development in serverless solutions on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/products/), 
to deploy [functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [apps](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) 
and even [containers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/bringing-the-best-of-serverless-to-you).

I answered an [interview](https://voxxeddays.com/microservices/2018/09/16/guillaume-laforge-on-serverless-solutions-on-google-cloud/) 
on the theme of microservices, and how this maps to the Google cloud products.

And the video of my presentation was published on YouTube:

Here's the abstract of the session:

> Plenty of novelties in the Serverless offering of Google Cloud Platform, whether you're developing functions, apps or containers.
>
> Let's get started with the new modern runtimes for the venerable Google App Engine, 
> sandboxed thanks to the open source gVisor container sandboxing technology. 
> Cloud Functions is now GA with Node.js, but also offers new languages like Python to let you implement your functions.
> If you need more flexibility, you will also be able to run serverless containers: just dockerize your project and off you go!
> 
> But the crux of the show has to be the new open source project, Knative, a collaboration of Google with key vendors like Pivotal, 
> IBM, Red Hat or SAP, which offers a set of portable building blocks on top of Kubernetes to build serverless platforms. 
> Additionally, you will be able to try out Knative on Google Kubernetes Engine thanks to a dedicated add-on.
> 
> In this session, we'll review all the new serverless-related features of Google Cloud Platform with concrete demos, 
> so you can get started easily and rapidly.
