*   Cédric Champeau developed a new **Gradle plugin for JBake**, a static site generator, allowing developers to render static websites directly as part of their Gradle build process.
*   An **update to the Grails Api Toolkit plugin** was released, providing enhanced support for building APIs with various paradigms including REST, RPC, and HATEOAS.

**II. Articles**
A wide array of articles covered best practices, tutorials, technical explanations, and debugging tips:
*   **Groovy Style Guide**: Guillaume Laforge shared a style guide, reinforcing best practices and echoing a Twitter discussion about the overuse of `def`.
*   **Static Blog Creation**: Cédric Champeau provided a detailed guide on creating static blogs using JBake, Gradle, and GitHub.
*   **Performance and Language Features**: Brendon Anderson wrote on Groovy Memoization for performance optimization, while Ken Kousen explored Groovy's date support. Jochen Theodorou explained class duplication and its causes.
*   **Understanding Groovy**: An article titled "Why is Groovy groovy?" aimed to clarify the language's fundamental appeal.
*   **Grails-Specific Topics**:
    *   **Debugging and Diagnostics**: Burt Beckwith offered a method for diagnosing Spring-Security-Core login errors.
    *   **Auditing and Logging**: André Steingreß covered the Grails Audit plugin for tracking application changes.
    *   **Testing**: André Steingreß contributed two articles on Grails testing with Cucumber, detailing functional testing approaches. Another article explored Grails Cucumber testing with HTTPBuilder and RemoteControl, showcasing a multi-faceted approach.
    *   **Project Maintenance**: Hubert Klein Ikkink shared tips for cleaning up Grails projects, followed by André Steingreß's suggestion for a comprehensive cleanup using an `rm` command.
    *   **Database Integration**: Michael Scharhag blogged about using database views within Grails applications.
    *   **Integration Tutorials**: A tutorial guided users through developing a Grails application with Facebook Connect.
    *   **Framework Overview**: An article provided a broad overview of the Grails web application development framework.

**III. Presentations**
The "Presentations" section highlighted recordings from past conferences, offering insights into various Groovy and Grails aspects:
*   Hubert Klein Ikkink (MrHaki) presented "Getting Groovy" at GR8Conf Europe 2013, likely an introduction to the language.
*   Ken Kousen advised Java developers on "similar tasks in Groovy" at 2GX, covering application building/testing, database access (relational and NoSQL), and web services.
*   Craig Atkinson presented on the advantages of using the **Geb functional testing library** for creating robust, readable tests with JUnit and Spock, and configuring it for multi-browser testing, at GR8Conf US 2013.
*   Kyle Boon reviewed and compared three frameworks for building RESTful Web Services (Grails, Dropwizard, and Ratpack) at GR8Conf US 2013, assessing them on code readability, maintainability, deployment, metrics, scalability, and testability.
*   Joe Rinehart discussed essential **security topics for Grails** (and Java) Web applications at SpringOne2GX 2013, demonstrating Grails' ability to simplify security implementation and highlighting pitfalls in highly dynamic code.
*   Ryan Vanderwerf explained how to set up Terracotta and **cluster a Grails application** using Ehcache, HTTP Session in Tomcat, and Quartz at GR8Conf US 2013.

**IV. Community Discussions and Contributions**
*   **Mailing-list discussions**: Dinko Srkoč announced a stream extension to Groovy's Sql facility, with potential for inclusion in the core language, indicating ongoing community innovation.
*   **Code snippets**: Tim Yates shared attempts to implement Groovy's `collate()` method using Java 8 streams and lambdas, and provided a practical snippet for displaying a text-mode spinner icon during long tasks.
*   **Tweets**:
    *   Cédric Champeau advocated for bundling basic dependencies (ASM, Antlr, Commons-CLI) directly into the standard "groovy" JAR to simplify deployment.
    *   Andrés Almiray expressed a desire for a Gradle portal plugin.
    *   Dierk König emphasized Groovy's pragmatic philosophy of "getting things done."
    *   Community efforts included groovy.io seeking hackathon sponsors and news about the Grain static site generator's dynamic rendering.
    *   Practical Grails tips were shared, such as a command to generate JIRA bug report zips and the `force-ssl` plugin's `@SSLRequired` annotation.
    *   News on tooling included Gradle 1.11-rc1 being available via GVM.
    *   Dan Woods released a new Grails plugin aimed at simplifying and streamlining RESTful renderer implementation.

**V. Other News, Books, and Events**
*   **Other news**: Jacob Aae Mikkelsen continued his Grails diary series.
*   **Books**: The "Groovy 2 Cookbook" received a dedicated website and a review, serving as a valuable learning resource.
*   **Events**: SkillsMatter revamped its website, showcasing the upcoming Groovy / Grails eXchange (GGeX) 2014 edition. Dan Woods was scheduled to speak about Grails 2.3's REST capabilities at a San Francisco meetup.
