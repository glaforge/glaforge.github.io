The article discusses the evolving trend of "programming in the cloud," building upon the existing practice of deploying applications in cloud environments. While the author expresses some reservations about the current readiness for full-scale cloud-based development, they highlight two particularly useful tools available on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that significantly enhance specific development workflows.

The primary tool introduced is the **Google Cloud Shell console**. This built-in feature provides a pre-configured terminal directly within the Google Cloud console, offering immediate access to a user's GCP project environment. A key advantage of Cloud Shell is that it comes with a comprehensive suite of command-line tools already installed and ready to use, including essential utilities like Gradle, Maven, and the gcloud SDK. Furthermore, it is pre-configured for seamless interaction with other cloud services, allowing users to run commands and manage their projects with the familiarity of a local computer terminal but within a cloud-native context. Accessing Cloud Shell is straightforward, initiated by clicking a specific icon (represented by `>_`) located in the top right corner of the GCP console, which then launches the terminal in the bottom section of the screen.

Beyond its command-line capabilities, the article emphasizes the **Cloud Shell's integrated code editor**. This editor can be launched by clicking a "pen" icon, which not only provides a full-screen view of the terminal but, more notably, opens a "proper" file editing interface. The editor is based on Eclipse Orion's web editor and includes fundamental features necessary for code development, such as a file browsing pane to navigate and select files, and syntax highlighting to improve code readability and understanding.

The author posits that as these built-in web editors become more sophisticated and user-friendly, the transition towards truly developing in the cloud will accelerate. While the author acknowledges a continued preference for local machine development for many tasks, they identify crucial scenarios where Cloud Shell offers distinct advantages. Specifically, tasks that are "network hungry" benefit immensely from Cloud Shell's superior network infrastructure, which is significantly faster and "snappier" than typical home internet connections. The article provides examples such as running Docker build commands or fetching large volumes of dependencies for Node, Maven, or Gradle projects, stating that these operations are "much nicer and faster" when performed within Cloud Shell. The added capability of editing project files directly within this high-speed environment further streamlines and quickens these development processes.

The author's exploration and write-up of these features were prompted by a recent announcement on the Google Cloud blog regarding the beta launch of the Cloud Shell's integrated code editor, indicating a push by Google Cloud to enhance its in-cloud development offerings.
