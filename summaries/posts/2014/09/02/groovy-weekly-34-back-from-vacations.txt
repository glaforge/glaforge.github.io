This Groovy Weekly edition, marking the return after a summer break, provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments, releases, news, articles, and community activities within the Groovy ecosystem. The overarching theme emphasizes Groovy's continued growth, particularly in mobile and build automation contexts, alongside a vibrant and active community.

**Key Highlights and Major Announcements:**

The standout news item is the **New York Times' decision to adopt Groovy and its Android support** (specifically in the upcoming Groovy 2.4), along with RxJava, to modernize and make its Android application more "reactive." This represents a significant endorsement for Groovy's capabilities in high-profile, production-grade mobile development.

Related to this, **Groovy 2.4-beta-3** was released, featuring a crucial improvement for Android developers: reduced bytecode size. This is achieved by not generating unneeded synthetic methods, directly addressing the method count limitations prevalent in Android applications.

The upcoming **SpringOne2GX conference in Dallas** is also highlighted as a major event for the Groovy community, promising a wealth of news and presentations in subsequent weeks.

**Software Releases and Updates:**

Several key components of the Groovy ecosystem saw new releases or release candidates:

*   **Groovy 2.4-beta-3:** As mentioned, this release is significant for Android developers due to its bytecode size reduction.
*   **Ratpack 0.9.8:** Introduced HttpClient testing support, dangling request detection, and reactive stream support, enhancing its capabilities as a reactive web framework.
*   **Griffon 2.0 RC-2:** Another important release candidate for the desktop application framework.
