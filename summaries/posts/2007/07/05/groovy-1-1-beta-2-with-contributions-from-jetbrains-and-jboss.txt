The Groovy team announced the release of **Groovy 1.1-beta-2**, marking another significant milestone in their aggressive roadmap towards the final Groovy 1.1 release, anticipated in October. This beta release integrates several crucial advancements, making Groovy more robust and interoperable with the broader Java ecosystem.

Two contributions are specifically highlighted as pivotal to this release:

1.  **Full Generics Support and Enhanced Annotation Integration:** Building upon the Java 5 annotation support introduced in Groovy 1.1-beta-1, this release brings comprehensive support for **generics**. The development team actively collaborated with JBoss developers, who integrated Groovy into JBoss Seam, allowing for rigorous testing of both annotation and generics support. This testing was instrumental in ensuring a high-quality release. A key achievement emphasized by the Groovy team is that **Groovy is now the first alternative dynamic language for the JVM to fully support both annotations and generics**. This capability significantly enhances Groovy's integration potential with major enterprise application frameworks such as EJB 3/JPA, JBoss Seam, Google Guice, and Spring, enabling developers to leverage modern Java features within their Groovy codebases seamlessly.

2.  **Joint Java/Groovy Compiler from JetBrains:** A major contribution to the project comes from JetBrains, who provided a **joint Java/Groovy compiler**. This innovation stems from their work on the IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Groovy and Grails. The new compiler eliminates previous challenges associated with managing Java and Groovy codebases, such as the need for clean separation to avoid cyclic references and the complexities of build configurations. With the joint compiler, the Groovyc compiler can now compile **both Groovy and Java source files in a single, streamlined step**, simplifying the development and build processes considerably.

Beyond these two principal contributions, the Groovy team also implemented numerous other enhancements and bug fixes since the first beta release:

*   **Improved Java 5 Annotation Usage:** The team refined the usage of Java 5 annotations, specifically addressing previous omissions like the lack of support for annotations on method parameters.
*   **Generics Bytecode Information:** The support for generics ensures that the generated bytecode properly includes the reflection information necessary for runtime tools like JPA, facilitating deeper integration with persistence frameworks.
*   **Static Imports:** While available since beta-1, static imports continue to contribute to more concise and readable Groovy code, complementing the other Java 5 feature integrations.
*   **Grails Integration (ConfigSlurper):** Continuing the "symbiotic relationship" between Groovy and Grails, the Grails team integrated its new `ConfigSlurper` mechanism into Groovy. This feature aims to simplify application configuration for developers.
*   **Return of the Classical For Loop:** Responding to significant user demand, the traditional `for` loop syntax has been reintroduced into Groovy.
*   **Enhanced Named Parameters:** Named parameters can now be used on top-level statements without requiring parentheses, allowing for more expressive and fluent code, as demonstrated by examples like `move x: 10.centimeters, y: 8.centimeters`.

Furthermore, the development efforts included a focus on cleaning up the Groovy grammar, improving code coverage, and enhancing the performance of Groovy, particularly in highly concurrent scenarios and on parallel machines. In total, this new release integrates approximately one hundred bug fixes, enhancements, and new features.

On the tooling front, the Eclipse plugin for Groovy recently released version 1.0.1, while the progress on the IntelliJ IDEA plugin is noted as "awesome," encouraging users to explore its capabilities.

Groovy 1.1-beta-2 is available for download, and detailed release notes can be found in the project's JIRA bug tracker. The team expressed gratitude to all users, contributors, and committers for their collective efforts in making this release possible.
