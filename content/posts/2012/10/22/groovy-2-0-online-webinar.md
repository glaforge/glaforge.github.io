On Thursday, at 15:30 GMT+1, I'll have the pleasure to present a Groovy 2.0 update presentation live, online, in the form of a webinar. The webinar will be showcased through [webex here](http://bit.ly/groovy2webinar). The video will later be made available on [SpringSource's YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/SpringSourceDev), for those who want to see it afterwards at a more convenient time.  

In the meantime, here's the title and abstract of that [presentation](http://bit.ly/groovy2webinar):

> What's new in Groovy 2.0?  
>   
> Groovy is a very popular alternative language for the JVM that continues to bring more developer productivity and more performance after each release. In this webinar, we'll dive through the new developments in the recently released Groovy 2.0.   
>
> A lot of the Groovy users are using the language as a Java scripting language, or sometimes as a better Java. First of all, not all of them need the dynamic capabilities, nor do they need all the library improvements provided by Groovy. For the latter, Groovy becomes more modular with smaller core modules that you can compose. For the former, in addition to its usual dynamic features, Groovy 2.0 adds static type checking, allowing you to ensure the correctness of your code before it ships and quickly spot early errors at compile time. Also, not everybody needs dynamic features at all times, and the natural extension to static type checking is static compilation. With static compilation, Groovy 2.0 generates fast and performant bytecode like Java, and shields key parts of your code base from possible interferences of dynamic features, making critical paths both faster and immune to monkey patching. But when you need fast and performant dynamic logic, Groovy 2.0 also features the integration of the "invoke dynamic" support coming up with JDK 7 and beyond.
