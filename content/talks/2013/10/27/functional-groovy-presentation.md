I've had the pleasure of being invited at the [Scala.IO](http://scala.io/) conference to speak about the functional aspects of Groovy, as the conference was also open to other functional language.  

The Groovy programming language, since its inception, has always been pretty functional, in particular with the cornerstone that our Closures represent to serve as first-class citizen functions in the language.  

Inspired by other nice talks from Andr√©s, Paul, Arturo, I've created my own deck that I've posted on SpeakerDeck and that I embed below. Please be sure to have a look at the "resources" section of that deck, for further pointers on functional programming with Groovy.  

The talk has been recorded and should be published on InfoQ sometime soon.
