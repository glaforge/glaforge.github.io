Scott Hickey, the project lead for the Groovy Eclipse plugin, has officially announced the immediate availability of a new version of the plugin. This release is particularly significant as it now fully supports the official Groovy 1.0 release, marking a major milestone in the integration of Groovy development within the Eclipse integrated development environment.

The announcement emphasizes the critical need for users to update their Eclipse project build paths to specifically use Groovy 1.0. This step is essential to ensure the plugin functions correctly and that there is no version mismatch between the Groovy plugin itself and the Groovy version configured for existing projects.

This updated plugin introduces a host of new features and improvements designed to enhance the development experience for Groovy programmers using Eclipse:

1.  **Context-aware "Run as Groovy"**: The "Run as Groovy" option in Eclipse's context menus is now more intelligent. It will only appear on Groovy files that are genuinely executable, rather than indiscriminately appearing on all Groovy files, streamlining the user interface.
2.  **Integrated "Run as JUnit" for Groovy**: A significant addition is the availability of "Run as JUnit" for Groovy unit tests. This feature integrates seamlessly with Eclipse's standard JUnit view, allowing developers to see test results, progress, and failures in a familiar and structured format. While "Run as Groovy" for JUnit tests will still display output in the console view, the dedicated JUnit integration provides a more robust testing experience.
3.  **Enhanced Launch Configurations**: Both "Run as Groovy" and "Run as JUnit" now automatically create Groovy Launch Configurations. These configurations are added to the Launch history, enabling the convenience of the "run last launched" toolbar button, making it quicker to re-execute recent Groovy applications or tests.
4.  **Keyboard Shortcuts for Running and Debugging**: For increased productivity, new keyboard shortcuts have been introduced. Developers can now use `Alt-Shift-X-G` to run a Groovy file directly, which also creates a Launch Configuration. Similarly, `Alt-Shift-X-D` can be used to start the debugger for a Groovy file, also generating a Launch Configuration.
5.  **Integrated Groovy Console Access**: The plugin now provides convenient options to launch the Groovy Console directly from the project's popup menu. Users can choose to open the Groovy console either in a separate window or within the standard Eclipse console view. Crucially, both console options are launched with the project's classpath, ensuring that all project dependencies are available within the interactive console session.
6.  **Limited Code Assist**: A highly anticipated feature, the plugin now offers limited code assist functionality. This includes assistance for methods and variables defined within the same file, as well as support for Default Groovy Methods, providing a basic level of intelligent code completion to aid development.
7.  **Streamlined Plugin Updates**: Going forward, the process for updating the Groovy Eclipse plugin will be simpler. Users will be able to pick up future updates automatically using the "Search for updates..." feature in Eclipse, eliminating the need to use "Search for new features."

The announcement also acknowledges the significant journey the plugin has undertaken over the past nine months. The project lead, Scott Hickey, expressed gratitude to Edward Povazan, James Ervin, and David Kerber for their tremendous effort, without which the plugin's advancements would not have been possible.

In addition to the current announcement, the article references a previous "Getting Started" guide published on EclipseZone, indicating ongoing community interest and a growing user base for the Groovy Eclipse plugin. This latest release, with its robust Groovy 1.0 support and numerous feature enhancements, represents a considerable step forward in making Groovy development a more integrated and efficient experience within the Eclipse environment.
