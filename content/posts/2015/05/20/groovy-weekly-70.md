Last week, Codehaus has gone the way of the dodo. The lights are switching off. A page is turning.

  

So please remember about our infrastructure changes, as we move the Groovy project through the incubation process at Apache: the [JIRA issue tracker has moved](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY/), and don’t forget that the [Groovy mailing-lists are also moving](http://www.groovy-lang.org/mailing-lists.html). The [Apache Git repository](https://twitter.com/glaforge/status/588809178958925824) is now the new mainline, but you can contribute pull requests on the new [Apache Groovy Github mirror](https://twitter.com/glaforge/status/588960808094326784). Be sure to update all your bookmarks, and register on the new mailing-list!

  

Beside that, there’s one particular item in the news below that I’d like to highlight here, that’s the [great and thourough presentation on Spock](https://speakerdeck.com/szpak/smarter-testing-java-code-with-spock-framework). If you want to learn the latest and greatest about Spock 1.0, that’s the slide deck you must have a look at!
