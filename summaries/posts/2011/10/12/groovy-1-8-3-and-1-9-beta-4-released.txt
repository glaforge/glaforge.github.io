The Groovy development team has announced the release of Groovy 1.8.3 and Groovy 1.9-beta-4. These releases are primarily focused on bug fixes and minor enhancements. While there are ongoing "interesting developments" like static type checking for Groovy code and invoke dynamic support for performance, these advanced topics are explicitly reserved for future discussions. The article's main purpose is to highlight several often-overlooked minor enhancements included in these new versions.

Here are the key enhancements detailed in the announcement:

**Enhancements available in both Groovy 1.8.3 and 1.9-beta-4:**

1.  **Customizing the `groovysh` prompt:**
    *   Addressing a long-standing request (GROOVY-2832), users can now customize the prompt of the Groovy shell (`groovysh`).
    *   This feature is particularly useful for applications that embed the Groovy shell infrastructure, allowing them to present a custom message instead of the default `groovy>`. This can help differentiate various embedded shell instances or indicate specific contexts with pre-defined variables.
    *   Customization can be achieved through two methods:
        *   Exporting an environment variable named `GROOVYSH_PROMPT` with the desired message.
        *   Passing the system property `-Dgroovysh.prompt=myMessage` as an argument when launching `groovysh`.
    *   The article provides a screenshot demonstrating the use of fancy characters for a personalized prompt on a Mac OS X console.

2.  **Launching remote Groovy scripts:**
    *   Traditionally, the `groovy` command takes a local file path as an argument to execute a script or class.
    *   A new capability allows the `groovy` command to execute scripts located remotely on the internet.
    *   For example, scripts hosted on services like the Groovy Web Console can be run directly by providing their "raw content" URL. The article gives an example of running a "Hello World" script using `groovy http://groovyconsole.appspot.com/raw/110001`.
    *   A crucial warning is included, advising users against blindly executing remote scripts from untrusted sources.

3.  **Formatting dates for a specific time zone:**
    *   Groovy already offers convenient shortcuts for date and calendar formatting.
    *   A new variant has been introduced to format a date and time according to a specified `TimeZone` object.
    *   This allows developers to display dates precisely for a particular geographical or temporal context.
    *   An example demonstrates formatting a `Date` object using a pattern (`'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mmZ'`) and a `TimeZone` object (e.g., `TimeZone.getTimeZone('GMT+2')`), resulting in output like `"2011-10-13 00:53+0200"`.

**New features exclusively available in Groovy 1.9-beta-4:**

1.  **Viewing generated bytecode from the Groovy console:**
    *   This feature is primarily aimed at Groovy developers who need to understand the low-level bytecode generated by the Groovy compiler, although the author notes that most users won't typically need this insight.
    *   When using the Groovy Swing console, the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) browser can now display the corresponding bytecode.
    *   To access this:
        *   Launch the Groovy console (`groovyconsole` command).
        *   Open a script or class.
        *   Activate the AST browser (`CTRL-T` or menu item).
        *   Crucially, select the "class generation" phase from the drop-down box within the AST browser and choose a *class node* in the AST tree to view its bytecode. A screenshot illustrates this functionality.

2.  **Control over Global AST Transformations:**
    *   Global AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformations, such as those used by Grape (dependency management) or the AST builder, are powerful but can sometimes introduce a small compilation overhead or be undesirable when embedding Groovy in applications. They might also be present in a library on the classpath but not actively used, yet still impacting compilation.
    *   Groovy 1.9-beta-4 introduces the ability to selectively disable these global transformations via the `CompilerConfiguration` object.
    *   Developers can specify a list of transformation class names in `CompilerConfiguration.disabledGlobalASTTransformations` to prevent them from being applied during compilation.
    *   The article provides a unit test excerpt demonstrating this: an `AstBuilderTransformation` is shown to work by default, but when explicitly listed in `disabledGlobalASTTransformations`, attempts to use `AstBuilder` within a script will fail, proving the transformation has been successfully bypassed.

In summary, the Groovy 1.8.3 and 1.9-beta-4 releases, while mainly focused on stability, introduce several practical and developer-centric enhancements, ranging from shell prompt customization and remote script execution to advanced bytecode inspection and fine-grained control over the compilation process.
