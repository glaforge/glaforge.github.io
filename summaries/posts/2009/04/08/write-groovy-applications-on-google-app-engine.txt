This article announces a significant development for the Groovy programming language: its official support on the newly released Google App Engine Java platform. The author emphasizes that this news had already begun to circulate widely, even reaching various mailing lists, and notes that a colleague, Didier Girard, had already blogged about the support for both Java and Groovy on the platform.

The integration of Groovy into Google App Engine's Java environment was a collaborative effort. SpringSource, a company heavily involved with the Groovy language, worked directly with Google to ensure seamless compatibility and optimal performance for Groovy applications on the platform. The article specifically thanks Jochen Theodorou, Matt Taylor, and the author themselves for their crucial contributions in making this support a reality.

To facilitate this announcement and ensure Groovy's readiness for Google App Engine, a key update to the language, Groovy 1.6.1, was released the day prior to this announcement. This version included essential fixes specifically tailored for the App Engine Java platform, ensuring stability and functionality.

The article also highlights a practical detail regarding access to the new platform: initially, Google App Engine Java will only be available to 10,000 developers. This suggests an early access or limited beta phase, urging interested developers to sign up quickly.

To assist developers eager to start using Groovy on App Engine, the author has provided valuable resources. These include a comprehensive tutorial guiding users through their first steps with Groovy on the platform. Furthermore, to demonstrate Groovy's capabilities and conciseness, the author has developed and shared a small, yet functional, demo application. This demo combines Google Maps, a Geocoding service, and Flickr integration, all written in a remarkably compact 90 lines of Groovy code, showcasing the language's efficiency and suitability for web development on App Engine. The article concludes with an enthusiastic invitation for developers to enjoy this new opportunity.
