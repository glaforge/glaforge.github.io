Being a groovy despot, I was in the process of redeploying groovy's web site and also the latest snapshot jars of the distribution which a lot of guys have asked for. But I was having some problems with my setup, ssh connection, maven goals, etc. With Trygve and Bob, we were chatting about that, and here is an interesting snippet of the ongoing discussion:

> trygvis: bob: dist is a recursive symlink
> bob: yes, I know
> bob: it's broken
> bob: I'll fix it
> bob: and I'll smack the next person who tells me about it
> trygvis: DO IT NOW! [Guillaume] LOL :-)))
> bob: FUCK YOU
> trygvis: OK!!
