In two weeks, I'll be flying east, much further east than I've ever been! I'll visit Singapore! And I'll have a pretty busy week with several events: conference, meetup, user groups, brown bag lunch... and I'll talk about Groovy, Machine Learning, and chatbots!

First of all, on Wednesday 31st, I'll participate to the [Singapore Java User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/singajug/events/240026369/?eventId=240026369), where I'll give an update on [Apache Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) (the latest improvements, new features, the roadmap).

Thursday 1st, I'll visit [Crédit Agricole CIB](https://www.ca-cib.com/our-global-presence/asia-pacific/singapore), for a brown-bag lunch about Machine Learning. They did a fun survey to decide which topics I should cover! And funnily, this is in this office that is maintained and developed a banking project on which I worked more than ten years before!

Then, it's Voxxed Days Singapore time! I'll talk again about the Machine Learning APIs offered by Google Cloud, as well as a few words about TensorFlow and Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

Then, on Saturday 3rd, two events, one organized by the GDG Singapore, which will be a [workshop on building chatbots](http://peatix.com/event/263477/view), using API.AI and Cloud Functions, and covering the Google Home and Assistant too.

And the last event will be held in Google's offices, on the theme of [data science](https://events.withgoogle.com/going-beyond-data-science/), where I'll will also give a presentation on chatbots, the Google Assistant with Google Home, with API.AI for the conversational interface, and Cloud Functions for the business logic.

It's gonna be a pretty busy week, and I'm looking forward to meeting tons of developers in Singapore, as well as reconnect with some of my friends & former colleagues living in the area!
