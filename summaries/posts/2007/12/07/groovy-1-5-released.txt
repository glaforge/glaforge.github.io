G2One, Inc., a professional services company specializing in Groovy & Grails, in collaboration with the Groovy development team, proudly announced the release of Groovy 1.5. This major update introduces significant new features, performance enhancements, and improvements to the Groovy ecosystem.

The article begins by defining Groovy as a dynamic language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) designed for seamless integration with the Java platform. It highlights Groovy's Java-like syntax, enriched with language features inspired by Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby. A key advantage emphasized is its ability to allow developers to reuse existing Java libraries and safeguard their investment in Java skills, tools, and application servers. Groovy's versatility is broad, suitable for various applications ranging from ad-hoc shell scripting that leverages Java APIs to building comprehensive web applications using frameworks like Spring and Hibernate through the Grails web framework. Additionally, Groovy can be easily integrated into existing applications to externalize business logic, create Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), and provide capabilities for templating and XML parsing.

A central feature of Groovy 1.5 is its full integration of key features from Java 5, including annotations, generics, static imports, and enums. The article positions Groovy 1.5 as the *sole* alternative dynamic language for the JVM that enables developers to fully leverage frameworks heavily reliant on annotations, such as Spring's @Transactional or JBoss SEAM (both noted for offering extended Groovy support). Similarly, the inclusion of generics significantly aids frameworks like JPA and Hibernate in correctly handling typed collections, enhancing type safety and developer productivity.

Beyond Java 5 integration, this release introduces new meta-programming capabilities, a contribution attributed to the Grails project developers, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between the two projects. Further syntax enhancements have been incorporated to simplify and ease the development of Domain-Specific Languages. A significant focus was also placed on performance improvements, resulting in a "much snappier" new version, a claim supported by reports from teams utilizing Groovy in mission-critical applications.

Since the Groovy 1.0 release, the development team has also dedicated efforts to enhancing the development toolchain. This includes the creation of a joint Java/Groovy compiler, which allows developers to seamlessly mix and match Java and Groovy classes within the same compilation step. GroovyDoc, an equivalent to JavaDoc, has been developed for documenting Groovy classes. The interactive shell has been improved to be truly interactive, offering useful command completions for increased productivity. Furthermore, the Groovy Swing console has also received enhancements, thanks to the dedicated Swing team and the assistance of Swing expert Romain Guy.

For users of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), the article highlights robust support. JetBrains' JetGroovy plugin for IntelliJ IDEA is particularly praised for its advanced coding capabilities, which include syntax highlighting, code completion, the ability to run scripts and unit tests, debugging functionalities, and even refactorings. Eclipse users can continue to utilize the Groovy Eclipse plugin, and Sun is actively working on a NetBeans plugin for Groovy and Grails.

The announcement also points to additional resources for those seeking more in-depth information, including an upcoming article on InfoQ detailing the novelties of Groovy 1.5. Readers are also directed to an interview with Groovy Project Manager and G2One VP Technology, Guillaume Laforge, recorded at QCon 2007, and a G2One team interview on JavaLobby.

Guillaume Laforge, the author of the announcement, extends his gratitude to all individuals involved in this release, including the Groovy developers, patch and documentation contributors, users who reported bugs or requested features, and book authors. The article specifically acknowledges the significant contributions of several well-known companies:
*   **IBM** contributed improvements and upgrades to the Eclipse plugin to support the latest version of the language.
*   **Oracle** enhanced JMX support, allowing remote beans to be called as if they were local.
*   **Sun** provided meeting rooms for developer gatherings and a powerful 8-core, 8-CPU machine for high-load concurrency testing.
*   **JetBrains** was instrumental in the development of the joint Java/Groovy compiler and their "awesome" plugin.
*   **JBoss** provided assistance in refining Groovy's support for annotations and generics.
Laforge concludes by emphasizing that while it's impossible to list everyone, all contributors are integral to Groovy's success and the high quality of this new milestone.

Finally, the article directs interested users to the detailed JIRA release notes for a comprehensive list of changes since the last release candidate and encourages immediate download and trial of Groovy 1.5 from the official website.
