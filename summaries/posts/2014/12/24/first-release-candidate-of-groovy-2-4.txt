The Groovy team has announced the release of Groovy 2.4-rc-1, the first release candidate for their upcoming major version, Groovy 2.4. This release, presented as an "Xmas present" following the 2.3.9 update, signifies a crucial step towards the final stable version planned for January.

The Groovy 2.4-rc-1 introduces several significant enhancements and new features designed to improve the development experience and expand Groovy's capabilities:

1.  **Official Android Development Support:** A standout feature is the full, official support for the Android development platform. This means developers can now build complete Android applications using Groovy. A key benefit highlighted is the dramatic reduction in boilerplate code compared to Java, while ensuring that performance and memory consumption remain on par with traditional Java-based Android applications.
2.  **Performance Optimizations:** The release candidate incorporates a multitude of performance improvements. These optimizations have been applied to both statically compiled Groovy code and dynamic code, aiming to make Groovy applications run more efficiently. An illustrative micro-benchmark report is provided as an example of these gains.
3.  **Optimized Memory Use:** To further enhance resource management, some compiler internals have been reworked. This modification is specifically aimed at reducing the overall memory consumption of Groovy applications.
4.  **Traits Refinements:** The concept of traits, a mechanism for code reuse, has received further refinements. A notable addition is the ability to specify that a trait can only be applied to a particular type hierarchy, allowing for more controlled and robust trait implementation.
5.  **Bugfixes:** As with typical software updates, Groovy 2.4-rc-1 includes a substantial number of bugfixes, contributing to increased stability and reliability.

The Groovy team emphasizes that this is a release candidate, and as such, they are actively seeking community involvement. Users are strongly encouraged to test this version against their existing projects and report any regressions or blockers they encounter. This feedback is critical for ensuring the stability and quality of the final Groovy 2.4 release.

For those interested in exploring the new features, detailed information about the closed tickets is available in the Groovy 2.4-rc-1 release notes. The release candidate can be downloaded from the beta Groovy website, and comprehensive documentation for this version is also provided. The final Groovy 2.4 version is targeted for release in January, pending the satisfactory assessment of stability and community feedback. The announcement concludes with an acknowledgment and thanks to the community for their ongoing contributions and support.
