It took us a while to get it finished, but I assure you it was well worth the wait, and [Groovy in Action, 2nd edition](http://www.manning.com/koenig2/), is real! I just received my copies this morning!

Congrats to my fellow co-authors, and in particular to Dierk and Paul for their patience and dedication to this project, without whom the book would have never gone through its print stage!
