My friend Geert is running his own Mastodon server, and welcomed me on his instance at: uwyn.net/@glaforge.
With Twitter, you can access your analytics to know how your tweets are doing, how many views you’re getting. Working in developer relations, it’s always interesting to get some insights into those numbers to figure out if what you’re sharing is interesting for your community.</description></item><item><title>Workflows Tips and Tricks</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/workflows-tips-and-tricks/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 14:15:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/workflows-tips-and-tricks/</guid><description>Here are some general tips and tricks that we found useful as we used Google Cloud Workflows:
Avoid hard-coding URLs Since Workflows is all about calling APIs and service URLs, it&amp;rsquo;s important to have some clean way to handle those URLs. You can hard-code them in your workflow definition, but the problem is that your workflow can become harder to maintain. In particular, what happens when you work with multiple environments?</description></item><item><title>Choreography vs Orchestration in Microservices and Best Practices</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/talks/choreography-vs-orchestration-in-microservices-and-best-practices/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 21:56:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/talks/choreography-vs-orchestration-in-microservices-and-best-practices/</guid><description>We went from a single monolith to a set of microservices that are small, lightweight, and easy to implement. Microservices enable reusability, make it easier to change and scale apps on demand but they also introduce new problems. How do microservices interact with each other toward a common goal? How do you figure out what went wrong when a business process composed of several microservices fails? Should there be a central orchestrator controlling all interactions between services or should each service work independently, in a loosely coupled way, and only interact through shared events?</description></item><item><title>A Cloud Run service in Go calling a Workflows callback endpoint</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/a-cloud-run-service-in-go-calling-a-workflows-callback-endpoint/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Sep 2022 16:02:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/a-cloud-run-service-in-go-calling-a-workflows-callback-endpoint/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s all Richard Seroter&amp;rsquo;s fault, I ended up dabbling with Golang! We were chatting about a use case using Google Cloud Workflows and a Cloud Run service implemented in Go. So it was the occasion to play a bit with Go. Well, I still don&amp;rsquo;t like error handling&amp;hellip; But let&amp;rsquo;s rewind the story a bit!
Workflows is a fully-managed service/API orchestrator on Google Cloud. You can create some advanced business workflows using YAML syntax.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring Website Changes with Workflows Cloud Functions and Sendgrid</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/monitoring-website-change-wwith-workflows-cloud-functions-and-sendgrid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 15:53:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/monitoring-website-change-wwith-workflows-cloud-functions-and-sendgrid/</guid><description>Every year in France, around mid-September, there&amp;rsquo;s a special weekend where everyone can visit some famous places, usually closed the rest of the year. That&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Journée du Patrimoine&amp;rdquo;. For example, you can visit places like the Elysée Palace or the Matignon Palace, if you want to see where the French president, or the French prime minister work. However, for some of those places, it&amp;rsquo;s tricky to register online to book a slot, as there&amp;rsquo;s always a high demand for them.</description></item><item><title>Schedule a Workflow Execution</title><link>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/schedule-a-workflow-execution/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2022 17:06:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://glaforge.github.io/posts/schedule-a-workflow-execution/</guid><description>There are different ways to launch the execution of a workflow. In previous articles, we mentioned that you can use the gcloud command-line tool to create an execution, you can also use the various client libraries to invoke Workflows, or use the REST API. A workflow itself can also invoke other workflows!
But today, I&amp;rsquo;d like to tell you how to schedule the execution of a workflow. For that purpose, we&amp;rsquo;ll take advantage of Cloud Scheduler.</description></item></channel></rss>
