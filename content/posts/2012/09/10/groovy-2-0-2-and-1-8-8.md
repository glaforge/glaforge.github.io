I'll echo here the two new releases of the [Groovy programming language](http://groovy.codehaus.org):

> This is with great pleasure that the Groovy development team announces the **releases of Groovy 2.0.2 and Groovy 1.8.8**.   
> 
> Those two releases are essentially just **bug fix releases**, with only minor improvements. In particular, work has been done in the area of the static type checker and static compilation, in the GroovyScriptEngine, as well as further performance improvements for the "invoke dynamic" support as well as plain Groovy. We also upgraded the version of GPars of the distribution to use the newly released 1.0-beta-3.   
>
> For the details of both releases, please have a look at the JIRA changelog here: for Groovy 2.0.2: [http://bit.ly/gr202](http://bit.ly/gr202), and for Groovy 1.8.8: [http://bit.ly/gr188](http://bit.ly/gr188)   
> As usual, you can **download Groovy **in our download area: [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download)  
>   
> Thanks a lot to all those who contributed to those releases.   
>
> I'd also like to seize this opportunity to highlight our contribution page, to those who are **interested in contributing to Groovy**: [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Contributing](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Contributing)   
>
> Going forward, we're going to propose a list of JIRA issues you might have a look at, if you want to get started working on the Groovy project: [http://bit.ly/gcontrib](http://bit.ly/gcontrib)   
>
> And on the contribution page mentioned above, at the bottom of the page, we feature a table containing wider goals or side projects that you might be interested in contributing to.   
>
> So don't hesitate to come back to us with ideas or with questions regarding those possible areas of contributions, and we'll gladly welcome your help!
