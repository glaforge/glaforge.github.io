Last week took place the second GroovyOne meeting in Paris, gathering the main Groovy developers. The event went fairly well, despite some disagreement we need to iron out, we made quite a lot of[progress](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GroovyJSR/Paris+Groovy+Meeting+report) on the Groovy front towards 1.0.

It's been a real pleasure to meet together again, and I must say I really [had a lot of fun](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/jsr241) there. But this meeting could not have been possible without the help and sponsoring of different actors. That's why I particularly want to thank all those who helped me make this happen.

First of all, [Codehaus](http://www.codehaus.org/)' [Bob McWhirter](http://www.openxource.com/) alloted a budget to help us pay for the accomodations. And we were also generously sponsored by two Groovy fans building software which embed Groovy: [Ludovic Dubost](http://www.ludovic.org/) who's working on [XWiki](http://www.xwiki.org/), an Open Source second generation Wiki engine and application platform, and [Benjamin Mestrallet](http://www.exoplatform.com/) who's been building [eXo Platform](http://www.exoplatform.com/), powerful Open Source corporate portal and content management system. And the final thanks go to [Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/alexismp), a Sun architect and consultant, who kindly granted us access to a fully-equiped meeting room in Sun's parisian Customer Briefing Center.
