The past week’s been pretty calm, in terms of news, but a few of them really stood out.

[Netflix again leverages Groovy for scripting its user experience API](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2015/02/11/how-a-netflix-tech-innovation-can-unleash-creativity-in-your-business/print/) (additional coverage following last week’s announcement).

The Gradleware team delivered [Gradle 2.3](http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/gradle-2-3-released)! Congrats guys!

And closer to home, a very important discussion about [moving Groovy into a foundation](http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Moving-Groovy-to-a-Foundation-td5722483.html) has started, inviting members and representatives of different foundations to join and offer their views and experience on the matter.
