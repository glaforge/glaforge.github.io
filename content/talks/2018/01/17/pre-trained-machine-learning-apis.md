Last month, for the first time, I visited Riga (Latvia), for the [DevTernity conference](https://devternity.com/). I really enjoyed my time there, and wish to come back with other topics next time. The organizers took very well care of the speakers, and the presentations were very interesting.

I had the pleasure to talk about the [pre-trained machine learning APIs](https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/) provided by Google Cloud Platform, and say a few words as well about [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Cloud ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/).

The talk was recorded, and I wanted to share with you the video and the slides of the presentation.
