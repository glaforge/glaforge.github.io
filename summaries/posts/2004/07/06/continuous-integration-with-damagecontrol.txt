The article strongly advocates for **DamageControl** as an essential tool for any Open Source project, labeling it as one of the "great tools" that must be adopted. It introduces DamageControl as a specific implementation of a **continuous integration (CI) system**, drawing parallels to other well-known CI tools like CruiseControl.

The core functionality of DamageControl is to **automate the project build process** following every code modification. Specifically, whenever a developer makes a commit to the project's Source Control Management (SCM) system, DamageControl automatically triggers a new build. This automation is highlighted as particularly useful and effective when the build process incorporates **full test suites**, ensuring that changes are immediately validated against existing tests and integrated smoothly.

A key benefit of DamageControl is its ability to provide **real-time notifications** regarding the outcome of these builds. Developers are promptly informed whether their latest commit resulted in a successful or failed build. The article mentions several channels through which these alerts are delivered, including **email, IRC, and Instant Messaging**, allowing for immediate feedback to the development team.

The author provides a personal testament to DamageControl's utility, stating that it allowed them to verify the successful integration of their last commit on the **Groovy** project. Furthermore, the article points out an additional valuable feature: the capability to display the build status publicly. Project maintainers can embed a link to an image on their website that visually indicates whether the most recent build passed or failed, often represented by a "green" status for success. This public indicator offers transparency and quick assurance regarding the project's current stability.

In summary, the article presents DamageControl as a vital CI system that significantly streamlines open-source development by automating builds upon every commit, providing instant feedback to developers through various notification channels, and offering a public visual indicator of the project's build health, ultimately fostering more efficient integration and improving overall project stability.
