Pivotal just announced it’s decision [to stop sponsoring and funding the development of the popular Groovy and Grails Open Source projects](http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/groovy-2-4-and-grails-3-0-to-be-last-major-releases-under-pivotal-sponsorship). As a result, both Groovy and Grails are looking for new sponsors willing to further help develop the projects full steam!

The [Groovy programming language](http://groovy-lang.org) has been around for a while for more than 11 years. During that time, it has nicely evolved from a side hobby project to the very mature and successful alternative language it is today, used by Fortune 500 companies throughout the world, in various projects and contexts.

With 1.7 million downloads in 2012, 3 million in 2013, and well over 4 million in 2014 (definitive numbers still need to be calculated), Groovy is leading the pack of the JVM language ecosystem, and continues seeing positive growth.

There are many ideas the Groovy team wants to develop further, features we want to bring to life, improvements we want to make, to keep Groovy always ahead of the curve, to help you developers be productive on the JVM platform. For that, we’ve been thankful for having had a handful of us able to work full time on the project, and we’re looking forward continuing to do so under a new umbrella.

The Groovy community has always been a key driver for the language, providing feedback, bug reports, contributions big and small, and we hope that you will help us find a solution to make Groovy shine as bright as ever.

Of course, we’re going to continue to develop Groovy, open it to new horizons like we did for the Android platform, implement new features, fix bugs, increase performance, complete the new documentation, launch the new website, and more. Your contributions will obviously be more than welcome to sustain the project’s pace. We’re looking forward to working with you all to push Groovy forward!

If your company is interested in discussing funding of the project, and employing members of the Groovy team, please don’t hesitate to contact us directly ([sponsorship@groovy-lang.org](mailto:sponsorship@groovy-lang.org)). Thanks in advance for your help, and keep on groovy’ing!
