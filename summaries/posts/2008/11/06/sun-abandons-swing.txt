The provided article expresses profound sadness, perplexity, and strong criticism regarding Sun Microsystems' reported decision to progressively abandon its Swing framework in favor of the newer JavaFX technology. The author bases this concern on a report by "Kirill" (linked in the article) that circulated on java.net.

The core of the author's argument is that Swing is an exceptionally valuable and capable framework that Sun is unwisely discarding. He describes Swing as a "very good framework for building rich client applications" and asserts that, from his experience, it is "even better than what exists in the .Net world, or compared to things like SWT or Cocoa." He views Swing as a "gem" that Sun is leaving "in the cold." The author argues that Swing had significant potential for continued evolution and market leadership, citing ongoing advancements such as new application and timing frameworks, SwingLabs, improved painters, new look-and-feels, and a robust ecosystem of open-source and commercial components. He believes Swing had "great chances to keep up with the rest of the world, and even keep its bleeding edge and stay ahead of the curve."

In stark contrast, the author is highly critical of JavaFX, the technology Sun is reportedly "betting everything on." He dismisses JavaFX as "half-backed" and claims that "nobody cares about" it. He questions the rationale for using JavaFX when established competitors like Adobe Flex and Microsoft Silverlight are "so much more advanced and ready for prime-time, thought and tool'ed for the designer in mind." The author also highlights JavaFX's problematic public image, recalling instances where it "shamelessly crash[ed] all the JavaOne keynote demos."

The author contends that Sun's shift in focus to JavaFX has already had detrimental consequences, specifically leading to the progressive loss of "key talented employees." These employees, he notes, "preferred sailing to more gorgeous seas," and the author explicitly states he cannot blame them for seeking better opportunities elsewhere. This brain drain, coupled with the strategic abandonment, means Swing is "dying."

The article concludes with the author's deep bewilderment at Sun's strategic decision-making. He struggles to understand "Why abandonning such a great technology?" While acknowledging the reality that "it's not always the best technologies that win and prevail," he questions the logic of discarding a "competitive advantage in one area" to pursue a "new shiny toy of the day" – especially one that appears to be inferior and less mature than its rivals and has faced public failures. The author is ultimately "perplexed" by Sun's choice to sacrifice a mature, high-quality framework like Swing for an unproven and seemingly less compelling alternative.
