This article begins by acknowledging the widely recognized benefits of Ruby on Rails, describing it as a "kinda cool" framework that significantly streamlines the development of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) oriented web applications. The author notes the "well-deserved hype" surrounding Rails due to its efficiency and time-saving capabilities.

However, the author immediately expresses skepticism regarding Rails' truly "revolutionary" status. The core argument posited is that a robust Java Web framework can achieve the same results as Rails. While conceding that Java might inherently be more verbose and require "a few more lines of code" compared to some scripting languages, the author contends that this difference is largely mitigated by the enhanced productivity offered by "top-notch IDEs" like IntelliJ. Ultimately, the author suggests that the perceived verbosity "doesn't really matter" when overall productivity is considered.

To illustrate this point, the article references Tada List, a basic "ToDo list" application built with Rails, presenting it as an example of a "nice little app" showcasing what Rails can do.

The central piece of evidence supporting the author's argument is Blabla List, a Java-based application developed by Geert Bevin. Bevin created Blabla List specifically to demonstrate that a Java framework could not only replicate but potentially surpass the functionalities offered by Rails applications. Blabla List is characterized as a "better clone" of Tada List. Crucially, Bevin identified and subsequently fixed "severe security issues" that were present in the original Tada List. Beyond rectifying these vulnerabilities, Blabla List also implemented all the existing features of Tada List and added several advanced functionalities, including a REST API, reorderable lists, and integrated drag-and-drop support. Notably, Bevin achieved this enhanced and more secure application with "just 50% lines of code more" than the original Rails equivalent, directly challenging the notion that Java is inherently less efficient or more unwieldy for modern web development.

The article details the technological stack used for Blabla List: it employs Laszlo for its "cute flash user interface" and the RIFE framework for the backend, which the author enthusiastically describes as "wonderful" and capable of "rock[ing] the pants off of Rails," strongly implying its superior performance or development experience compared to Rails.

The article concludes with a firm assertion: "A good Java MVC framework can do at least as good as Rails, if not better," with the Blabla List project serving as compelling empirical evidence for this claim. The author ends by encouraging readers to "sign up for free" on Blabla List to experience its capabilities firsthand.
