This article critically examines a decision made by JBoss regarding the technology chosen for their Wiki portlet within JBoss Portal, labelling it as an "unlogical choice."

The central point of contention is JBoss's selection of **JSPWiki** as the foundational technology for their Wiki portlet. Rather than contributing to the existing JSPWiki project, JBoss opted to **fork and trim** it to specifically embed a Wiki engine into their portal as a portlet. The author finds this approach questionable, suggesting that contributing to an existing project would typically be a more collaborative and efficient route.

The author then immediately proposes an alternative: **XWiki**, arguing that it would have been a far more logical and advantageous choice for JBoss. Several key arguments are put forth to support XWiki's superiority in this context:

1.  **JBoss Open Source Federation Membership:** XWiki is an official member of the JBoss Open Source Federation. This existing relationship suggests a natural alignment and potential for easier collaboration and integration within the JBoss ecosystem.
2.  **Pre-existing JBoss Portal Integration:** XWiki already possesses proven capabilities for integration with JBoss Portal. This means a solution was readily available and likely required less custom development or "forking and trimming" compared to adapting JSPWiki.
3.  **Universal Portlet Container Integration:** Beyond JBoss Portal, XWiki is designed to integrate seamlessly into *any* portlet container. The article provides concrete evidence for this broader compatibility by highlighting that the **eXo Platform** already successfully embeds XWiki as a portlet. This demonstrates XWiki's versatility and its readiness for portlet environments.

In conclusion, the author expresses bewilderment at JBoss's decision, describing it as "weird." The article strongly implies that choosing to fork and adapt JSPWiki, especially when a well-aligned, already integrated, and highly versatile alternative like XWiki (a JBoss federation member) was available, represents a puzzling and suboptimal strategic choice. The core argument is that JBoss overlooked a more logical, integrated, and potentially less resource-intensive solution in favor of a custom, forked implementation.
