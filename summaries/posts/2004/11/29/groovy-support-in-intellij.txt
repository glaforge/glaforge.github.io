This article details a significant community initiative aimed at integrating comprehensive Groovy language support into JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA, a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The central focus is a feature request submitted by Kjetil JD to JetBrains' official issue tracker, identified as SCR 40320 and aptly titled "Integrated Groovy-support."

The core argument put forth in this feature request emphasizes the necessity for better, more robust integration of Java bytecode-based scripting languages within IntelliJ. Among these languages, Groovy is specifically singled out and advocated for as the primary candidate for such advanced support. The rationale provided for prioritizing Groovy is its unique status as "the only Java bytecode scripting language that has a backing JSR" (Java Specification Request). This formal backing implies a level of standardization and official recognition that, according to the request, warrants Groovy receiving "proper support" within IntelliJ, akin to the already well-established and comprehensive support provided for languages like Java and XML.

The article highlights a critical deficiency in the current state of Groovy support, noting that the existing "Groovy IntelliJ plugin is somewhat stalled" and that "no progress on that front" has been made. This stagnation in community-driven or prior plugin development directly underpins the appeal made in the article: a call for "a little help from our JetBrains friends" to advance the integration of Groovy. This indicates a desire for official JetBrains resources and development efforts to be dedicated to this feature, rather than relying solely on external contributions.

A significant aspect conveyed by the article is the overwhelming community support for this feature request. At the time of its writing, the request had garnered an impressive 937 votes. This substantial number of endorsements propelled it to a prominent position on JetBrains' tracker, ranking as the 12th most voted feature overall. This high ranking and vote count serve as clear indicators of strong user demand and interest in seeing Groovy officially and fully integrated into IntelliJ IDEA.

In conclusion, the article not only outlines the origin and the detailed rationale behind the request for native Groovy support but also powerfully demonstrates the considerable user interest and community momentum behind this initiative. It serves as a direct call to action, encouraging any users interested in seeing enhanced Groovy capabilities in their preferred IDE to cast their votes on the mentioned feature request, thereby further amplifying the community's voice and potentially influencing JetBrains to prioritize its development.
