At out last [OSS-Get Together](http://ossgtp.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/18Aout2005) meeting in Paris last thursday, we've had the chance to have [Thierry Templier](http://templth.blogspot.com/), a [Spring modules](http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=139) and a [Jencks](http://jencks.org/) commiter, make an introductory presentation of the [Spring Framework](http://www.springframework.org/)

On our wiki, he made available two powerpoints in French:

*   a big [118-slides presentation on Spring](http://ossgtp.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Main/18Aout2005/PRES+SPRING+OSSGTP.PPT),
*   and a specific one on [Spring and JCA](http://ossgtp.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/download/Main/18Aout2005/PRES+SPRING+JCA+OSSGTP.PPT).

That's a lot of content to read for those of you speaking Moli√®re's tongue.

Moreover, on his blog, he's got a very interesting entry explaining how to [inject Groovy beans](http://templth.blogspot.com/2005/08/use-groovy-with-spring.html) with Spring or how to [access CICS transactions](http://templth.blogspot.com/2005/08/access-cics-with-spring.html) from Spring!
