The Groovy team has issued a dual announcement, detailing a rapid bugfix release, Groovy 2.4.3, alongside the significant news that Groovy has successfully passed the vote to enter the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) Incubator.

Firstly, the team announced the immediate availability of **Groovy 2.4.3**, which is presented as another maintenance release within the 2.4.x line. This particular update was released very quickly, just a week after the previous 2.4.2 version. The primary motivation for this rapid follow-up was the identification of "some regressions" that required prompt attention from the development team. Consequently, users who are currently operating on any version within the 2.4.x series are strongly advised to upgrade to 2.4.3 to incorporate these crucial fixes and enhancements. For a comprehensive understanding of all issues addressed and features improved in this specific release, users are directed to the official changelog, which is accessible at [http://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-2.4.3.html](http://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-2.4.3.html). The updated Groovy distribution itself can be downloaded, as customary, from the "new Groovy website" via the provided link: [http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html](http://www.groovy-lang.org/download.html).

Secondly, and perhaps more significantly for the long-term trajectory of the project, the Groovy team officially announced that the project has **passed the vote to enter the Apache Software Foundation Incubator**. This marks a pivotal moment for the Groovy language, signalling a move towards a new governance model and a broader, more robust community framework under the prestigious Apache umbrella. The confirmation of this successful vote can be reviewed through a linked mailing list message: [http://markmail.org/message/uaickpdsffd4gnzu](http://markmail.org/message/uaickpdsffd4gnzu).

The team outlined that the actual incubation process is expected to commence in the "coming weeks" and is anticipated to last "likely for a few months." During this incubation period, users should be prepared for a series of organizational and logistical changes. This will involve "moving things around," specifically the relocation of key project assets and infrastructure. This includes, but is not limited to, the project's source code repositories, the JIRA issue tracking system, and the various project mailing lists. These moves are necessary to align Groovy with the established procedures and infrastructure of the Apache Software Foundation. While these adjustments will inevitably lead to "a bit of change" for the community, the Groovy team has committed to maintaining transparent communication, promising to keep users consistently "posted on how we progress along" throughout the entire incubation journey.

In conclusion, the announcement from the Groovy team highlights both ongoing commitment to product stability through continuous maintenance releases like 2.4.3, and a major strategic shift towards enhanced project governance, sustainability, and community engagement by joining the Apache Software Foundation Incubator.
