I was playing with the [new IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Google App Engine](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/08/never-leave-your-Java-IDE-with-Google-Cloud-Tools-for-IntelliJ-plugin.html) yesterday. The plugin depends on the [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) to do its work. And I started exploring gcloud a little bit more.

I was experiencing some odd bug which prevented me to run my application locally with the App Engine's local app server. It was a bug which was present in an old version of gcloud and its App Engine component, so I had to update the SDK and its App Engine Java component to fix it. No big deal, but what I wanted to highlight here was a little detail about that upgrade process.

I love when SDKs give me information about what needs updating and what's new in the new versions I'm using!

I've been using [SDKMan](http://sdkman.io/) for dealing with various SDK installations, like those for Groovy, Grails, Gradle, etc, and I've always liked when it was telling me which SDK updates were available, what was new in SDKMan. And I'm glad to see that gcloud behaves the same, and gives informative details about what's new. So let's see that in action.

First of all, while debugging my problem with a colleague, he asked me which versions of the SDK and the App Engine component I had. So I ran the following command:

```bash
$ gcloud version
Google Cloud SDK 119.0.0
alpha 2016.01.12
app-engine-java 1.9.38
app-engine-python 1.9.38
beta 2016.01.12
bq 2.0.24
bq-nix 2.0.24
core 2016.07.21
core-nix 2016.06.06
gcloud 
gsutil 4.19
gsutil-nix 4.19
```

At the time of this writing, the latest version of gcloud was actually 127.0.0, but I had 119.0.0. And for the app-engine-java component, I had version 1.9.38 although 1.9.42 was available. So it was time to update!

```bash
$ gcloud components update

Your current Cloud SDK version is: 119.0.0
You will be upgraded to version: 127.0.0

I snipped the output to just show the details of the changes for the latest version of gcloud, but it showed me the actual changelog up until the version I had... and as I hadn't updated in a while, there was lots of improvements and fixes! But it's really nice to see what had changed, and sometimes, you can discover some gems you weren't even aware of!

So if you're working on some kind of SDK, with auto-update capabilities, be sure to provide a built-in changelog facility to help your users know what's new and improved!
