The Groovy development team is very pleased to announce the release of Groovy 2.0, the highly popular dynamic language for the Java platform.  
  
For the key highlights of this important milestone, Groovy 2.0 comes packed with:  

*   a static type checker to let the compiler tell you about the correctness of your code,
*   static compilation for the performance of the critical parts of your application,
*   modularity, splitting the Groovy JAR into smaller feature-oriented JARs and letting you create your own extension modules,
*   JDK 7 Project Coin syntax enhancements, so that Groovy is still as friendly as possible with its Java cousin,
*   and JDK 7 Invoke Dynamic integration to benefit from the support of the JVM for dynamic languages.

  
To learn more about all those great key new features, please [read the Groovy 2.0 article on InfoQ](http://bit.ly/groovy2) that I’ve written, detailing and explaining all those novelties.

We’d like to thank all our users, all the contributors and committers who made this important release a reality, thanks to their feedback, their support, and their contributions.  
  
Have a Groovy day!  
  
Guillaume Laforge, on the behalf of the Groovy team.
