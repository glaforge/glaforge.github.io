The Groovy development team and SpringSource are pleased to announce the **second candidate for Groovy 1.6**.  
This release is a bug fix release, and as you can see by looking at the [JIRA issues closed](http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&styleName=Html&version=13832) (almost a hundred), a lot of work has been done to ensure that our next major release is of great quality, and various improvements have been introduced -- check for instance the much nicer and thourough [output of GroovyDoc](http://groovy.codehaus.org/gapi/)!

This version obviously also contain all the performance improvements and features of the latest betas and RC. You can read more about them by reading the previous announcements:

*   [Groovy 1.6-beta-1](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2008/05/02/Groovy+1.6-beta-1+release+with+great+performance+improvements)
*   [Groovy 1.6-beta-2](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2008/10/09/Release+of+both+Groovy+1.5.7+and+Groovy+1.6-beta-2)
*   [Groovy 1.6-RC-1](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2008/12/22/Release+Candidate+for+Groovy+1.6+available)

You can download Groovy 1.6-RC-2 at the usual place: [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download)

And now, **we need your help to test drive this release candidate**! We need you to find possible critical bugs or regressions, so please make sure you try 1.6-RC-2 with your project, to be able to upgrade as soon as possible to the latest and greatest Groovy.

Thank you all for your hard work and your contributions. We're looking forward to your feedback.
