The article provides a succinct but highly impactful account of the launch of Free Mobile by Xavier Niel, highlighting the immediate and revolutionary effect of its pricing strategy on the French telecommunications market. The announcement, which followed a period of intense anticipation and "savamment orchestrated buzz," was met with a flurry of public reactions, predominantly expressed through humorous and astonished tweets.

The core of Free Mobile's disruptive entry revolved around two highly aggressive price points. While one plan was notably offered at just €2, a more significant stir was created by its "all-inclusive" unlimited plan, priced at an unprecedented €19.99. This pricing strategy instantly became the central theme of public discourse, as evidenced by the selection of tweets presented in the article.

The cited tweets collectively illustrate the profound shock and delight among consumers:

*   **Unprecedented Affordability:** Several tweets directly reference the incredibly low cost. One user humorously exclaims, "Finally we can say you have a 2-balles plan, my friend," using a slang term for €2. Another tweet marvels at the new perception of small currency, stating, "I will never look at a €2 coin the same way again," underscoring that such a small amount could now cover a month of mobile service. The practical impact is further emphasized by a tweet joking about almost leaving a €2 tip, before realizing it was "a month of plan."
*   **Challenging the Status Quo:** The launch is clearly seen as a shake-up for the established operators. A tweet, playfully attributed to Cantona, states, "When seagulls change operator, it's because they think they've become pigeons," strongly implying that existing customers felt exploited by their previous providers and were now recognizing a superior alternative.
*   **Boosting Purchasing Power:** Perhaps one of the most striking reactions comes from a tweet that boldly declares, "#Free has just done more for purchasing power in 5 minutes than Nicolas #Sarkozy in 5 years..." This comment not only highlights the immediate and tangible economic benefit Free Mobile offered consumers but also places it in a broader socio-economic context, suggesting a more direct positive impact on household budgets than governmental policies.
*   **Unlimited Value:** The €19.99 unlimited plan is also celebrated, with a witty tweet playing on a French health campaign, "#Freemobile 19,99€ all-inclusive. At that price, we'll finally be able to get 5 #Free and vegetables a day," a pun on "cinq fruits et légumes" (five fruits and vegetables).

The article concludes by posing a critical question about the future dynamics of the French mobile market. It speculates on the reactions of the incumbent operators: Orange, Bouygues Telecom, and SFR. The author wonders if Orange will "rush to react or see red," if Bouygues will "fortify its offers," or if SFR will "let itself be done in," clearly anticipating a significant competitive response and a potential price war triggered by Free Mobile's audacious entry.

In summary, the article effectively captures the groundbreaking nature of Free Mobile's launch, emphasizing its disruptive pricing strategies (€2 and €19.99 unlimited plans) and the overwhelmingly positive, humorous, and empowerment-focused public reception. It strongly implies that Free Mobile's entry marked a pivotal moment for consumer choice and affordability in the French mobile sector, forcing established players to re-evaluate their own market positions and offerings.
