This article details how Google's choice of XMPP for its Google Talk service has opened up opportunities for innovative remote procedure calls, specifically by leveraging the Groovy XML-RPC module to perform RPC over the Jabber network.

The summary begins by highlighting Google's entry into the Instant Messaging (IM) market with Google Talk and its strategic decision to use **XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)**. XMPP, popularized and standardized by the **Jabber Software Foundation**, is presented as an "open, secure, ad-free alternative" to established consumer IM services like AIM, ICQ, MSN, and Yahoo.

A key benefit of XMPP's open platform is its extensibility. The Jabber foundation developed **JEPs (Jabber Enhancement Proposals)**, which are standardized extensions to the protocol allowing for custom XML payloads. The article focuses on **JEP-0009**, a specific JEP that defines a method for transporting XML-RPC encoded requests and responses over Jabber/XMPP. This means traditional remote procedure calls, which typically require direct network connections, can now be routed through the Jabber messaging infrastructure.

To facilitate this, the article introduces **JiveSoftware's Smack library**, a Java library designed for interacting with XMPP. Smack was recently improved to support Google Talk's specific requirements, such as TLS/SSL connections, and allows developers to build custom payloads, including those for JEP-0009, to programmatically make RPC calls.

The core innovation discussed is the work by John Wilson, creator of the **Groovy XML-RPC** module. Wilson built upon the Smack library and its XML-RPC capabilities to add direct XML-RPC support through Google Talk. This new functionality, dubbed "**Groovy Jabber-RPC**," makes it possible to perform remote procedure calls by leveraging the existing Google Talk/Jabber infrastructure. Groovy's support for closures further simplifies exposing XML-RPC services.

The article then provides a practical demonstration with a simple "echo" service. It presents **Groovy code examples for both a server and a client**:
*   **Server Code:** Utilizes `JabberRPCServer` and `GoogleTalkConnection`. It defines a simple `echo` method using a Groovy closure and logs into Google Talk with a designated "serverId," then starts the server.
*   **Client Code:** Connects to Google Talk using `GoogleTalkConnection`, logs in with a "clientId," and then creates a `JabberRPCServerProxy` targeting the "serverId@gmail.com." The client can then call the `echo` method on this proxy as if it were a local object, demonstrating the transparency of the RPC.
The article notes that this enhanced Groovy XML-RPC library was, at the time of writing, only available in CVS Head and required two mutually authorized Google Talk buddies for the example to function.

Finally, the article explores the "why" and potential **use cases** for this technology, highlighting its significant advantages:
*   **Secure VNC Reverse Connect:** John Wilson's primary example illustrates how this can address the security concerns of VNC. Instead of opening a firewall port for VNC access, a Jabber RPC server could launch a VNC server that "reverse connects" to an external client, all initiated and managed through the secure Jabber channel.
*   **Triggering Continuous Integration (CI) Servers:** Allowing CI servers to be controlled or triggered remotely via Jabber-RPC.
*   **Home Automation:** Enabling remote control of home devices, such as adjusting heating, from anywhere using the Google Talk network.

A crucial argument for using Jabber-RPC over raw XML-RPC or standard SOAP is the inherent networking advantage:
*   **No Firewall Port Opening:** Services exposed via Jabber-RPC do not require opening specific ports on a firewall, making them safer against port scanning and unauthorized access.
*   **No DNS Entry Required:** The machine hosting the service does not need a public DNS entry, simplifying deployment in many scenarios.
*   **Leverages Google Talk Server:** All communication is routed through the robust and established Google Talk server infrastructure, abstracting away complex networking details for the developer.

In conclusion, the article presents Groovy Jabber-RPC as an interesting and powerful application of Google's open XMPP platform. It demonstrates how existing messaging infrastructure can be leveraged to create secure, firewall-friendly, and easily discoverable remote services, hinting at the future potential of services Google could provide through its extensible platform.
