The Groovy project team has officially announced the release of **Groovy 2.3.4**, categorizing it as a significant bug-fix version. This announcement serves to inform the community about the availability of the updated software and highlight the key areas of improvement addressed in this iteration.

A primary focus for the Groovy 2.3.4 release was the continued effort to resolve issues related to **anonymous inner classes**. The development team explicitly stated that they "continued on our hunt of bugs related to anonymous inner classes," indicating an ongoing and dedicated effort to stabilize and refine this particular language feature. This suggests that users who heavily utilize anonymous inner classes in their Groovy applications should find greater stability and fewer unexpected behaviors with this update.

Another major area of development and improvement in Groovy 2.3.4 involved extensive work on the **compatibility of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformations with static compilation**. The announcement refers to this as "big work," signifying a substantial investment of effort. This is a critical enhancement, as AST transformations are a powerful feature of Groovy for meta-programming and code generation, while static compilation is increasingly important for performance optimization and type safety in Groovy applications. Improving their compatibility means that developers can leverage the benefits of both features more seamlessly and reliably, potentially leading to more robust and performant Groovy code, especially in scenarios where compile-time checks are crucial.

Users are encouraged to **download Groovy 2.3.4** immediately. The download is available from the project's **new website**, [beta.groovy-lang.org](http://beta.groovy-lang.org/). The mention of a "new website" also suggests an update or migration of the project's online presence, which may include improved documentation or a better user experience.

For a comprehensive and detailed list of all resolved issues, bug fixes, and specific changes incorporated into Groovy 2.3.4, interested users are directed to consult the official **JIRA release notes**. These notes provide granular information that would be invaluable for developers looking to understand the exact scope of fixes and potential impacts on their existing Groovy projects.

The announcement concludes with a sincere expression of gratitude to all individuals who contributed to the Groovy 2.3.4 release, highlighting the collaborative nature of open-source software development. The overall tone is positive and encouraging, signing off with the familiar phrase "Keep on Groovy-ing!"
