The mythical eagle/lion is out the door, with a 0.0 version number! [Griffon](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Griffon) is a Grails-like framework for building rich Swing client applications (applets, webstart, standalone). Andres was [hinting](http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/coming_soon) at the [first release](http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/entry/griffon_takes_flight) of this new project, and [Danno just announced it](http://shemnon.com/speling/2008/09/announcing-griffon-00-1.html) officially after having shown some [nice preview](http://shemnon.com/speling/2008/08/griffon-and-greet-starting-to.html) of what it's all about by showing a Twitter client built with Griffon.

The Groovy swing team's long been hard at work to provide you with powerful declarative Swing UIs with the Groovy Swing builder, and they've now switched gears to go a big step further by really empowering developers to write, build and distribute clean MVC apps.

So, now, if you want to learn more about Griffon, the best thing to do is to just follow the white rabbit prey:

*   The [Griffon project page](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Griffon)
*   [Downloading and installing Griffon](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Installing+Griffon)
*   And the, just follow the [Griffon quick start](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Griffon+Quick+Start)

Congratulations to [Danno](http://shemnon.com/speling/), [Andres](http://www.jroller.com/aalmiray/) and [James](http://jameswilliams.be/blog/entry/index) for their hard work! They've been [tweeting](http://twitter.com/aalmiray) [like](http://twitter.com/shemnon) [mad](http://twitter.com/ecspike) these past days while getting Griffon ready.
