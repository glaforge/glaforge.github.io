Today is the celebration of the veteran day / remembrance day in various countries throughout the world. So I’ll start with a big thank you to our ancestors who fought for our freedom!

  

This week is also a busy week as a part of the Groovy core team is moving to Antwerpen in Belgium to speak about Groovy at the Devoxx conference.

  

My picks of the week, among the news below are: the release of Gradle 2.2, the release of ElasticSearch 1.4 which now standardizes on Groovy for its default scripting language, and the announcement of the dates of the Greach conference in Spain and its call for paper which is open.
