This edition of the weekly news brief highlights significant developments in the Groovy and Grails ecosystem, primarily focusing on a major Grails release and an upcoming conference.

**Main Points and Key Developments:**

The biggest news is the **release of Grails 2.4**, a substantial update bringing several key features. This version introduces **standalone GORM (Grails Object Relational Mapping) and GSP (Groovy Server Pages)**, allowing these components to be used independently of the full Grails framework. It also enhances **static compilation**, making it more intelligent by understanding even the dynamic aspects of Grails. Other additions include a **new asset pipeline**, support for **GORM sub-queries**, and a **new Maven plugin**.

The other major announcement is the impending **GR8Conf Europe week**, expected to feature numerous engaging presentations that will likely be made available online shortly after the event. The author expresses hope of publishing the weekly news brief in time despite the conference activities.
