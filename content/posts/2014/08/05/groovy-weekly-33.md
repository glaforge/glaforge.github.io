You probably remember Groovy and Gradle being selected in RebelLabs’ report as part of the 10 “kick-ass” technologies developers love? But I’m also happy to report that [Groovy won the Geek Choice Award](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/groovy-receives-geek-choice-award), showing how groovy Groovy is!

GR8Conf US 2014 last week is delivering tons of [great videos and materials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7wUp2KIa1hoMNn0r7JUVEg) from all the speakers that came to the conference, and I hope you’ll find time to watch a few. My personal highlight was the great Q&A talk by Scott Hickey and Jim McGill on looking back into [9 years of using Groovy at a big US insurance company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvpxRoLEq7M). Don’t miss it!

Also, if you missed GR8Conf US 2014, remember there’s [SpringOne2GX](http://springone2gx.com/) fast approaching, and the [early bird price for registering to the conference ends August 9th](https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/register), so be quick!

Last but not least, the Groovy Weekly schedule will slow down a little this month, as I’ll take some vacations! So I might be skipping a beat or two in the agenda, but fear not, Groovy Weekly will come back in full force in September!
