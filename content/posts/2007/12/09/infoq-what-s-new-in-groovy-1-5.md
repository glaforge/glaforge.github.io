My [announcement](http://glaforge.free.fr/blog/groovy/224) of the release of Groovy 1.5 triggered the publication of an article that I wrote for InfoQ detailing the new features in this new release. If you want to know what it contains, I invite you to read my article on InfoQ: [http://www.infoq.com/articles/groovy-1.5-new](http://www.infoq.com/articles/groovy-1.5-new)

And if you want to know a bit more about the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) language history, or about my reasons to be part of this project, or if you want to know more about the founders behind [G2One](http://www.g2one.com/), the Groovy and Grails company, here are a few pointers you may be interested in:

*   [Interview of Guillaume Laforge](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/12/interview-laforge-groovy) at QCon 2007, in March, in London
*   [G2One's team interview](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t103434.html) on JavaLobby
*   A recent [interview](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t103434.html) of me by the excellent Geertjan Wielenga from Sun on JavaLobby, who asked very good questions.

Let me give you a few other interesting pointers to presentations I've given recently:

*   My [keynote ](http://grails-exchange.com/guillaume-laforge#groovy-keynote)on Groovy at the [Grails eXchange](http://www.grails-exchange.com/) conference in London ([slides](http://www.grails-exchange.com/files/Guillaume-Laforge-Groovy-Keynote-Grails-eXchange-2007.pdf))
*   A [talk on Domain-Specific Languages in Groovy](http://www.grails-exchange.com/files/Guilliaume%20LaForge%20-%20DomainSpecificLanguages.pdf), also given at the Grails eXchange conference
*   I've also given a [talk on Groovy](http://ijtc.firstport.ie/UserFiles/IJTC_2007_Guillaume-Laforge-Groovy.ppt) and one on [Grails](http://ijtc.firstport.ie/lecture.aspx?lid=37) at the [Irish Java Technology Conference](http://ijtc.firstport.ie/) in Dublin. This was the first conference of this new conference series, and for a start, that was really wonderful, well organized, with a nice lineup of speakers. Kudos to the organizers.

And next week, I'll be at [JavaPolis](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Guillaume+Laforge) with [Dierk Koenig](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1932394842/ref=cm_plog_item_link) to present a general session on [what's new in Groovy 1.5](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Groovy+Update), and a BOF on the [cool things you can do with Groovy](http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Groovy+BOF+Update). I'll be happy to meet you there if you're attending JavaPolis!
