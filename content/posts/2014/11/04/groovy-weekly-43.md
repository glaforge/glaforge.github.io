This week, an InfoWorld article lists [Groovy among the 9 cutting-edge programming language worth learning today](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2840235/application-development/9-cutting-edge-programming-languages-worth-learning-next.html), although it reduces Groovy to a mere Java dynamic scripting language. Are you happy with the investment you made into learning Groovy a while ago?

We also have some nice releases, like the monthly Ratpack release, or the 1.0 versions of GroovyServ (for starting up your Groovy scripts at light speed), and Gaiden for making nice documentation with Markdown.

Jorge Franco keeps on writing some cool demos with GrooScript, to write your JavaScript apps in your favorite programming language. He also unveiled the new [GrooScript](http://grooscript.org/) website!

In the news section, I’ve also listed a couple refinements coming up in Groovy 2.4, with @DelegatesTo / @ClosureParams annotations alignments and the new @SelfType annotation for traits to restrict trait application.
