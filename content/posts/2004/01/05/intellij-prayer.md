That's incredible, but Robert S. Sfeir is at it again in the [EAP forum](http://www.intellij.net/forums/thread.jsp?forum=22&thread=63779&tstart=0&trange=15#760113). He produced one more prayer that we should all be repeating again and again. (I hope he won't mind me from quoting his holy words)

> Our IDEA who art in heaven  
> Hollowed be thy name  
> Thy IDE come, the EAP done  
> On earth as it is in heaven,  
> Give us this day our daily build,  
> And forgive our bug reports,  
> As we forgive those who report against us,  
> But lead us not into frustration,  
> Now and forever...
