[GR8Conf Europe](http://gr8conf.eu/) is over, but there’s a lot to learn from the conference, with all the interesting conference sessions that took place there in Copenhagen.

  

The themes for this week will be around GR8Conf, of course, but also about Groovy on Android, again the Swift language, and also the first impressive demo of Grails 3.0!

  

Right after the conference also took place the annual Groovy DevCon meetup, gathering core members of the Groovy team, Grails team, and members of the Groovy ecosystem. Lots of interesting tidbits about [what’s coming up in Groovy](http://bit.ly/gdc10notes)!

  

Fasten your seat belt, and without further ado, let’s get started!
