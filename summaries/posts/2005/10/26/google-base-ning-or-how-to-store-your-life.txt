The article provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of information management systems, contrasting traditional approaches with the ambitious but complex Semantic Web, and ultimately highlighting the emerging, more practical solutions exemplified by platforms like Ning and Google Base.

The author begins by critiquing traditional personal information managers (PIMs), PDAs, and various rich client and web applications. These systems, whether for personal or business use, are characterized by their "fixed and frozen structure." This rigidity means that any significant evolution or modification to an application's data model or functionality necessitates new development, often leading to costly redeployments and service interruptions. Examples include MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) and application generation engines, which, despite automating some aspects, still often result in fixed structures.

Next, the article introduces the Semantic Web as a proposed solution to these limitations. The Semantic Web envisions storing information in an "unstructured way" using RDF triples, which can be understood by different applications by sharing common ontologies (RDFS, OWL) and namespaces (like Dublin Core). Tools such as RDF stores (e.g., Jena/Joseki, Kowari) and powerful querying systems like SPARQL were designed to allow users to query multiple documents and stores simultaneously, facilitating the mixing of diverse information channels. However, the author notes a significant hurdle: the Semantic Web has "never really took off because of its inherent complexity to deploy and understand."

The narrative then shifts to more recent, widely adopted concepts that have "taken the blogosphere by storm": REST and tags. These principles underpin popular services like Flickr for sharing and tagging pictures, del.icio.us for tagging and sharing bookmarks, and Google Maps for sharing geographic data. The article emphasizes the role of public APIs, which enable the "mixing and matching" of these online services, leading to the proliferation of "mashups." The ability to subscribe to information through RSS or Atom feeds is also presented as a key component of this flexible, interconnected web environment.

A concrete example of these modern principles in action is presented with Marc Andreessen's "Ning." Ning builds upon the concepts of tags and REST, coupled with a custom content store, to allow users to build social software. The platform simplifies application development significantly: users define "types" to store data instances in Ning's content store (eliminating the need for tedious SQL coding), and then write simple PHP files to manage user interaction. Ning also offers the ability to clone and customize existing applications. A core feature is that all information is shareable (either public or private) and taggable, and every application and piece of data is accessible through "pivot URLs," which provide an automatic RESTful interface to the entire system. The author hails Ning as "Brilliant, really brilliant."

Finally, the article focuses on Google Base, which the author anticipates will be "the next big thing." While details were scarce at the time of writing, the author posits that Google Base aligns perfectly with Google's overarching goal of organizing the world's data, including personal information. The author suggests that Google's robust backend infrastructure, including the distributed Google File System (GFS) and the flexible BigTable database, provides a solid foundation for such a service. Google Base is expected to allow users to define their own flexible and malleable data types, create custom list and item views, share these with friends, and tag them. Crucially, the author foresees APIs on top of Google Base, enabling remote interaction with data and facilitating the creation of interconnected, data-driven applications. This vision is described as "a Semantic Web driven by data and by folksonomies," suggesting a more practical, user-centric approach to semantic data organization than the earlier, more academic Semantic Web initiative.

The author concludes by expressing a personal ambition—to build a system capable of storing his entire life, brain-dumping ideas into a common base, programmable through APIs, and made cross-linkable and categorizable with tags. The advent of Ning and Google Base, he notes, validates this long-held dream, making him feel that his ideas for the future of information technology are rapidly taking shape, and he expresses eagerness to explore these new platforms.
