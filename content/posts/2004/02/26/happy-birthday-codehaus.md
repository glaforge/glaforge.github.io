A year ago, [Codehaus](http://www.codehaus.org/) saw the light of day. And since, it gathered a lot of bright and talented persons working on innovative and very good quality projects. And moreover, those projects have a friendly licence scheme (I'm not a GPL/LGPL lover).

For a few months, I've been part of the Hausmates, thanks to my efforts in developing some code for [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), and I'm really proud of beeing part of it.

I wish a very happy birthday to Codehaus, and to all those who made it happen. Thank you Bob, and thank you James for Groovy ;-)
