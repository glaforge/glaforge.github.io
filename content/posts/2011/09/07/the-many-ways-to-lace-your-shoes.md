In my feed reader, I came across this nice image showing the [many ways to lace your shoes](http://pics.kuvaton.com/kuvei/17_ways.jpg)!  
I selected one of those that I'd like to try some day, it's very nice looking:

I think I've been using essentially the 4th and 7th for years.  

Which lacing scheme do you use?  

**Update:** There are even [sites dedicated to shoe lacing](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/index.htm)!
