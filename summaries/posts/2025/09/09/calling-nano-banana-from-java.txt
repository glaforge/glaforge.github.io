This article provides a detailed guide for Java developers on how to integrate and utilize the Nano Banana model, also known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image preview, within their LLM-powered applications using the Google GenAI Java SDK. It highlights Nano Banana's capabilities in generating, editing, and assembling images, emphasizing that these advanced functionalities are fully accessible from Java environments without requiring Python.

The author begins by showcasing the impressive image generation capabilities of Nano Banana, encouraging readers to experiment with it via Google AI Studio, the Gemini app, or its dedicated X/Twitter account (@NanoBanana). A crucial remark is made regarding compatibility with other LLM frameworks: while Nano Banana can be used with ADK for Java, it is not yet supported by LangChain4j because LangChain4j currently lacks support for models featuring output multimodality (i.e., returning both text and images). The article promises a future follow-up once LangChain4j support is implemented. It also clarifies that Nano Banana is fundamentally a chat model, meaning it can return both text (potentially including follow-up questions) and images, though an image is not always guaranteed in every response, and when present, there's typically only one.

To get started, Java developers need to add the `google-genai` dependency (version 1.15.0) to their Maven or Gradle projects. Authentication for the `Client` object can be configured in two ways:
1.  **Using a Google AI API key:** By building the client with `apiKey(System.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))`.
2.  **Using a Google Cloud project:** By specifying the `project`, `location`, and setting `vertexAI(true)`.

The article then delves into the three core functionalities:

1.  **Creating New Images:**
    Developers generate images by calling the `client.models.generateContent()` method. This requires specifying the model name ("gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview"), a textual prompt describing the desired image (e.g., "An impressionist oil painting of the port of La Rochelle..."), and a `GenerateContentConfig` object. The `GenerateContentConfig` must include `responseModalities("TEXT", "IMAGE")`. This setting is explicitly required when using Nano Banana with Google Cloud Vertex AI, and although it's implicit for the Google AI API endpoint, the author recommends always including it for code compatibility across both environments. The response contains various `Part` objects, and the image data (if present) is extracted from `part.inlineData().get().data().get()` and saved as a file, such as a PNG. An example demonstrates generating an impressionist oil painting from a text prompt.

2.  **Editing Existing Images:**
    Nano Banana "excels" at image editing, a capability that makes some consider it a "Photoshop killer." To edit an image, a variant of the `generateContent()` method is used, which accepts a `Content` object composed of multiple `Part`s. This `Content` object includes the existing image to be edited (provided as `Part.fromBytes()` from a file) and textual instructions for the desired changes (provided as `Part.fromText()`). The example shows how to transform the previously generated oil painting into a black and white ink noir comic drawing, changing the weather to rainy and the time to night.

3.  **Combining Several Images:**
    The model is also "extremely good" at combining multiple images, a valuable feature for applications like product marketing (e.g., placing a product in a new setting) or virtual try-ons. This functionality also uses the `generateContent()` method with a `Content` object. This `Content` object includes all the input images (each as `Part.fromBytes()`) along with textual instructions on how to combine them (as `Part.fromText()`). The article illustrates this by combining three separate images – a decor, a person, and a red dress – into a single composite image where the person is placed in the decor wearing the dress.

In conclusion, the author reaffirms that Java developers can effectively generate and edit images with Nano Banana, emphasizing that these powerful capabilities are fully accessible within the Java ecosystem without the need for Python. The article ends with an encouragement for readers to experiment with the model, unleash their creativity, and share their generated images.
