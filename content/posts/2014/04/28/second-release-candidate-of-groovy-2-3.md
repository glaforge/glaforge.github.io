The Groovy team is happy to announce the **release of Groovy 2.3.0-rc-2**. This should be the last release candidate until the final release in a couple days.  

This release ironed out a few bugs, for instance in generics handling, or made the groovydoc tool aware of traits.  

Note that the latest fixes in the traits support introduce a binary incompatibility compared to the previous release candidate.  

You can have a look at the JIRA release notes: [https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=20357](https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=20357)  
  
And you can download Groovy at the usual place: [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download)  

Thanks for your attention, and keep it Groovy!
