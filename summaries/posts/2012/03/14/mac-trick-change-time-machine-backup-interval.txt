The article details methods for customizing the automatic backup interval of Apple's Time Machine utility, addressing a common user concern that the default hourly backup schedule might be too frequent or intrusive.

Initially, the article presented a command-line trick, sourced from MacYourself, allowing users to modify this interval directly via Terminal. The core idea was to change a system default setting that controls how often Time Machine automatically initiates a backup. The specific command involved using `sudo` (requiring administrative privileges) to write a new default value for the `StartInterval` property within the `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto` configuration file. Users were instructed to specify the desired interval in seconds; for example, entering `-int 7200` would set the backup frequency to every two hours, as opposed to the standard 3600 seconds (one hour).

However, a significant update appended to the article highlighted a critical limitation: this Terminal command ceased to function effectively with Mac OS X Lion and subsequent operating system versions, despite its success in earlier iterations like Mac OS X Leopard. This rendered the initial command-line method obsolete for a large segment of Mac users running newer software.

Recognizing this limitation, the article provided an alternative solution suggested by a commenter named Thomas: the use of a third-party utility called "Time Machine Scheduler." This external application serves as a workaround for users running Lion or newer macOS versions who wish to customize their Time Machine backup intervals without relying on deprecated command-line methods. The article implies that this utility provides a user-friendly graphical interface or a more robust mechanism to achieve the desired control over backup frequency.

In essence, the article moves from a direct system modification approach for older macOS versions to recommending a dedicated third-party tool for modern systems, all with the goal of giving users more granular control over Time Machine's backup frequency to suit their individual needs and preferences.
