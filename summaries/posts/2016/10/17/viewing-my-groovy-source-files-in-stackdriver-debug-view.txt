The article details a practical experience using Google Cloud's Stackdriver (now Google Cloud Operations suite) to debug a Groovy application deployed on Google App Engine. The author, while preparing a demo for a Devoxx talk, encountered a bug in his Gaelyk Groovy application that used Glide for Datastore persistence, shortly after deploying a new version.

Upon encountering the bug, the author observed a stack trace in the Stackdriver logs, clearly indicating an error in `receiveTweet.groovy` on line 11. A surprising and convenient feature was the presence of a clickable link within the stack trace, despite the author not having explicitly linked his source code to the application beforehand. This link demonstrated Stackdriver's capability to pick up sources from various origins, including local files, Google code repositories, GitHub, BitBucket, or through a "source capture" mechanism.

Clicking the link led the author to a debug view in the Stackdriver console, which offered different methods to link or upload the source code. The author chose the "source capture" approach, which conveniently provided a `gcloud` CLI command. Executing this command in his terminal successfully linked his local source code with the traces in Stackdriver.

After this process, the Stackdriver web console displayed a comprehensive debugging interface. On the left pane, all Groovy source files were listed, with the problematic `receiveTweet.groovy` script highlighted. The central column presented the source code itself, with the exact line where the exception occurred highlighted in blue, directly above the detailed stack trace. The right-hand side of the interface also featured a live debugger view, which the author acknowledged as "pretty powerful" for its ability to debug a production application in real-time, though he did not explore this feature in detail within this post.

The author made two specific observations regarding Groovy language support within Stackdriver's debugger view. Firstly, he noticed that the Groovy source code lacked syntax coloring, a feature readily available for languages like Java, Go, Python, and JavaScript. Secondly, despite a warning message appearing in red that stated "only files with .java extension are supported" for certain functionalities, Stackdriver successfully displayed and highlighted the Groovy source code without issue, which the author found pleasantly surprising.

In his concluding summary, the author highly praises the immediate utility of being able to directly associate code with logs within the web interface, stating it's "pretty neat" for quickly identifying the source of problems. While acknowledging that developers will ultimately return to their IDEs for in-depth debugging and fixes, he emphasizes the convenience of Stackdriver for rapidly visualizing the error's origin and initiating the problem-solving process. He further highlights the live production debugger as a "killer feature," stressing its importance because local emulators and tests often fail to fully replicate the complexities and nuances of a running production environment. The ability to "introspect a running app" and "dive deeper in the running system" is presented as a compelling and invaluable capability for troubleshooting issues that are difficult to reproduce locally.
