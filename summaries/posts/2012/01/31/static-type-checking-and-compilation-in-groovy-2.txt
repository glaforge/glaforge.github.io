The provided "article" serves as an introduction to Cédric Champeau's significant work on integrating static type checking and static compilation into Groovy 2. Champeau, a core developer for the Groovy language, delivered a presentation on this topic at the Paris Groovy / Grails User Group, hosted at VMware offices, which is highlighted as "very interesting and instructive."

The summary of the content can be derived from the three resources linked within the initial text:

1.  **The Presentation on Static Type Checking and Compilation for Groovy 2:**
    Cédric Champeau's presentation focused on the ongoing efforts to bring static type checking and static compilation capabilities to Groovy 2. These features are crucial for enhancing Groovy's performance, improving IDE support through better code analysis and autocompletion, and enabling the detection of potential programming errors at compile time rather than runtime. This work represents a significant evolution for Groovy, aiming to combine its inherent dynamism and expressiveness with the benefits typically associated with statically typed languages.

2.  **Cédric's Blog Post About the Presentation (with additional comments, status update, and directions):**
    Following his presentation, Champeau published a blog post that elaborated on certain technical aspects and provided a more detailed update on the development status and future directions. A key area discussed in this post concerns the "method dispatch logic." Groovy's dynamic nature means that method calls are often resolved at runtime, which is a core challenge when trying to implement static compilation. The blog post likely delves into how Groovy 2 plans to statically resolve method calls where possible, while still accommodating the language's dynamic features. This involves carefully designing the type inference and compilation process to avoid breaking existing Groovy code or sacrificing its flexibility. The post also offers insights into the current progress of these features and outlines the roadmap, giving the Groovy community a clearer understanding of what to expect and when. This includes balancing the desire for performance and static safety with Groovy's "scripting language" feel.

3.  **Cédric's Blog Post Analyzing the Polls (preferences and expectations):**
    A crucial aspect of Champeau's approach is active community engagement, which is evident from his analysis of polls embedded within his presentation. These polls were designed to gather user "preferences and expectations" regarding static type checking and compilation in Groovy 2. The questions likely covered various aspects such as the desired level of strictness, how static checks should interact with dynamic features, the potential trade-offs users are willing to accept for performance gains or compile-time safety, and the overall usability of the new features. By actively soliciting feedback, Champeau aims to ensure that the development of these features aligns with the practical needs and desires of the Groovy developer community. The article explicitly states that the poll remains open, underscoring the ongoing nature of this feedback process and Champeau's commitment to involving the community in shaping Groovy's future.

In conclusion, the article highlights Cédric Champeau's foundational work on bringing static type checking and compilation to Groovy 2. This effort is characterized by a deep dive into technical challenges like method dispatch, a transparent communication of status and future plans through blog posts, and a strong emphasis on community feedback via polls to ensure the new features meet developer expectations while preserving Groovy's core strengths. This initiative is pivotal for Groovy's continued evolution, aiming to deliver enhanced performance, better tooling, and improved code reliability.
