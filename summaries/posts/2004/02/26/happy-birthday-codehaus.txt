This article serves as a celebratory reflection on the first anniversary of Codehaus, an open-source development community and project hosting platform. The author marks this milestone, highlighting Codehaus's achievements and expressing personal pride in being a part of the initiative.

Since its establishment one year prior to the article's writing, Codehaus has successfully attracted a multitude of "bright and talented persons." These individuals are actively engaged in developing and contributing to a range of "innovative and very good quality projects" hosted on the platform. A key characteristic of Codehaus projects, explicitly praised by the author, is their "friendly licence scheme." The author specifically notes a personal preference against GPL/LGPL licenses, implying that Codehaus projects typically adopt more permissive or developer-friendly licensing models.

The author reveals their personal involvement with Codehaus, having become one of the "Hausmates" (a term for community members) a few months before the article's publication. This membership was earned through their dedicated efforts in developing code for the Groovy project, which is a prominent project within the Codehaus ecosystem. The author expresses a profound sense of pride and satisfaction in being an integral part of the Codehaus community.

The piece concludes with a heartfelt birthday wish extended to Codehaus and an acknowledgement of gratitude to "all those who made it happen," emphasizing the collective effort behind its success. Specifically, the author offers thanks to "Bob" and "James" for their significant contributions to the Groovy project, underscoring their pivotal roles in its development. Overall, the article is a short but enthusiastic commendation of Codehaus's first year, its community, its projects, and its licensing philosophy.
