**Excitement and Details on Grails 3 (Primarily from SpringOne2GX Tweets):**

The most significant buzz at SpringOne2GX revolved around the **Grails 3 preview**, generating highly positive reactions from developers. Key aspects of Grails 3 include:

*   **Foundation:** It will be based on **Spring Boot**, allowing Grails applications to be packaged as **runnable JARs** and offering better integration with the Spring ecosystem.
*   **Build System:** A major change is the **abandonment of Gant in favor of Gradle** as the default build tool.
*   **Architecture Goals:** Grails 3 aims for improved **plugin modeling**, enhanced **eventing**, better support for **microservices**, and independence from the **Servlet API**.
*   **Development Experience:** It will introduce **application profiles** for different project types and make **controller debugging easier** by implementing controllers as Groovy traits.
*   **Micro-applications:** Developers will be able to create **micro-Grails applications** as simple Groovy scripts.
*   **Plugin Delineation:** The framework will feature a clearer distinction between code generation, build-time, and runtime aspects of plugins.
*   **Roadmap:** The plan is to release the **first milestone before the end of 2014** and the General Availability (GA) version before the next SpringOne2GX.
*   Graeme Rocher, during the SpringOne2GX keynote, famously demonstrated a **"tweetable full data-driven rest application"** built with Grails 3, highlighting its conciseness and power.

**Code Snippets and Integrations:**
