This article, written by a Java Champion and Groovy Language Developer, reflects on the most important skills for a Java programmer, particularly a senior one, drawing from the author's extensive career history. Prompted by an inquiry, the author concludes that the essential qualities boil down not to specific methodologies, technologies, languages, or specific soft/hard skills, but rather to two core attitudes: profound **curiosity** and an inherent **desire to share findings** with the world.

The author begins by providing a "bit of history" to illustrate how these core attitudes shaped his career. Starting as a junior Java developer in 2001, he highlights the importance of a good mentor in improving code design. Crucially, his early career was marked by intense curiosity; he regularly consumed Java and development-related news, blogs, and content to understand the latest trends, tools, and best practices beyond his immediate work tasks. This drive to learn from others and continuously improve his craft also led him to start blogging, seeing it as a way to "share back" useful knowledge he gained.

In 2003, a work requirement for extending an application through scripting led him to explore existing Java scripting solutions. Finding them inadequate, he discovered the nascent Groovy language. His curiosity compelled him to delve deep into Groovy's open-source codebase, encountering and fixing numerous bugs. He actively participated in mailing lists, filed bug reports, and submitted patches. This proactive engagement quickly led to an invitation to become an official committer on the Groovy project. Working within the open-source community, he gained profound knowledge of Java, the JVM, and open-source project dynamics. The public scrutiny of his contributions, he notes, pushed him to perfect his craft to an even higher standard than required at his day job.

His continued blogging and engagement in the "blogosphere" led to interactions with other open-source developers, culminating in the formation of a local meetup where he gave his first public presentation on Groovy around 2004. This networking connected him with professionals from major tech companies like Sun and Oracle, as well as smaller players. His growing visibility and expertise eventually led to an invitation to speak at JavaOne, a major international conference, marking the beginning of his broader outreach and travel to "spread the word" about Groovy. This journey culminated in him working on Groovy professionally, founding his own company focused on the project, and eventually landing his current role as a Developer Advocate at Google, a position he attributes directly to his developer advocacy and sharing activities.

The article then elaborates on "The ever changing nature of our field," underscoring the necessity of curiosity. The author argues that work, consuming a significant part of one's life, must be interesting and motivating to prevent boredom. Passion for one's craft, which for him began as a childhood hobby in programming, is key. To keep work engaging, developers should proactively push for project improvements, introduce new technologies, and continuously learn. The author stresses that in the rapidly evolving IT landscape, continuous learning isn't merely an option but a requirement to stay relevant. Without constant learning, skills stagnate, employability diminishes, and opportunities for fulfilling jobs are lost. Thus, curiosity is vital for both personal enjoyment and professional longevity.

The section "Sharing is caring" details the second core attitude. The author explains that sharing his knowledge and work not only helped others but also created invaluable opportunities for him. It led to meeting mentors, role models, and friends through blogging, tweeting, meetups, and conferences. Sharing his code, particularly through open-source contributions, was instrumental in connecting him with future employers, colleagues, and co-founders of his startup. Sharing fosters visibility, facilitates learning from new people, and builds a professional network that opens doors to significant career opportunities. Open source, in particular, is highlighted as a powerful mechanism for meeting great people globally and securing desirable jobs.

In conclusion, the author reiterates his central message: true mastery and career success for a developer are not about mastering particular tools or technologies. Instead, they are deeply rooted in being **curious** and **passionate** about one's craft, coupled with a commitment to **share** what has been learned with the world.

The article distills these points into two actionable calls:
*   **Be curious!** This will make daily work more interesting, facilitate learning new technologies, improve one's developer skills by learning from peers, enhance craft and expertise, boost employability, and can even lead to becoming an expert in the field.
*   **Share with the world!** This includes writing, blogging, tweeting, and presenting at meetups or conferences. It involves writing and sharing code, and contributing to open-source projects. Sharing leads to learning from others, meeting awesome peers and mentors, and creating diverse, interesting job opportunities.

The ultimate takeaway is a powerful synthesis: **Be curious and share with the world!** These two attitudes form the bedrock upon which all other valuable skills and career achievements are built in the dynamic field of software development.
