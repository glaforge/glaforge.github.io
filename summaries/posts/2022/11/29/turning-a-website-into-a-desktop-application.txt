This article addresses a common productivity challenge: managing numerous browser tabs and windows for frequently accessed web applications and websites. The author, like many readers, expresses a desire to transform these essential web services—such as email, calendars, chat applications, and social media platforms like Mastodon or Twitter—into dedicated desktop applications to streamline access and reduce the cognitive overhead of navigating through countless browser tabs.

Initially, the author explored macOS-specific solutions, being a long-time Mac user. This search yielded several applications and approaches designed for macOS, including both free, freemium, and paid options. Examples mentioned are Fluid, Applicationize (which creates Chrome extensions), Web2Desk, and Unite. However, a significant drawback identified with some of these methods was the creation of "big hundred-mega wrappers," implying inefficient or bloated application files. Another macOS-centric approach involved using Automator to create a pop-up window, but this was dismissed as it merely produced a temporary pop-up rather than a full-fledged, persistent application. The article also briefly notes promising open-source projects like Tauri and Nativefier as potential future alternatives.

The core of the article then pivots to introduce a highly practical and cross-platform solution available through the Google Chrome browser. This method is highlighted as beneficial not only for macOS users but also for those on Linux and Windows, making it widely applicable. A key advantage of this Chrome feature is that the target websites do not even need to be Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to be converted into standalone applications.

The article provides a clear, step-by-step guide on how to leverage Chrome for this purpose:
1.  **Navigate to the Website:** The user first opens the desired website in their Chrome browser.
2.  **Access "Create Shortcut":** By clicking on the triple-dot menu (top-right corner), then selecting `More Tools`, and finally `Create Shortcut`.
3.  **Customize and Configure:** A prompt appears allowing the user to customize the application's name. The system automatically reuses the website's favicon as the application's icon. Crucially, the user *must* check the `Open as window` option. This step is essential to ensure that the created shortcut launches as a standalone application window, distinct from the main browser, rather than merely opening a new tab in an existing browser window.
4.  **Standalone Application:** Once configured, the website can then be opened as a dedicated, standalone desktop application, providing an experience akin to a native program.

Following this detailed explanation, the author investigated whether a similar capability exists in other popular browsers, specifically Firefox. The findings for Firefox were less accommodating; the only comparable feature the author could locate was the ability to open Firefox in "kiosk mode," which forces a full-screen display. This was deemed unsuitable for the author's needs, as they desired a resizable window, not necessarily a full-screen experience. The author expresses hope that Firefox may integrate a similar flexible "open as window" feature in the future.

The article concludes with the author's satisfaction with the Chrome-based solution, having found an effective way to address their initial problem of managing frequent web applications and simplifying their workflow by transforming them into easily accessible desktop applications.
