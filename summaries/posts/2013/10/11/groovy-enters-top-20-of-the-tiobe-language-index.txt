The article announces that the Groovy programming language has, for the first time, entered the top 20 of the TIOBE Programming Community Index for October 2013, specifically reaching the 20th position. This milestone is highlighted as a significant achievement for what the index describes as a "lightweight Java language."

Groovy is characterized as an object-oriented scripting language designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its full compatibility with Java is emphasized, making it straightforward to combine Groovy with existing Java programs. The article notes Groovy's success in a competitive landscape of lightweight JVM languages, mentioning that it has surpassed other well-known alternatives like Scala (ranked #36), JavaFX Script (#41), and Clojure (#76) in this particular index. The article also poses a question about whether Groovy can maintain its top 20 position in the subsequent months.

The author attributes Groovy's recent surge in the TIOBE index primarily to a significant "buzz" generated around the language in the month prior to the index's publication. This increased attention stemmed from Groovy being a prominent theme within the Pivotal Spring.IO stack and a key topic at the SpringOne2GX conference, which demonstrably helped boost its ranking.

However, the author immediately introduces a strong cautionary note regarding the reliability and interpretability of the TIOBE index numbers. The main argument is that the ranking algorithm essentially measures "buzz or hype" surrounding a language at a given point in time, rather than its actual, consistent usage. Evidence for this unreliability is provided by Groovy's own fluctuating history in the index, where its position has varied widely between the 20s, 30s, and 50s from one month to another. Consequently, the author concludes that the TIOBE numbers are "not really reliable or meaningful" and do not accurately reflect the real usage of a programming language, questioning whether the current top 20 position will be sustained.

Despite these significant reservations about the TIOBE index's methodology and its capacity to gauge actual usage, the article concludes by affirming Groovy's substantial presence and importance in the programming world. It cites impressive statistics, specifically 1.7 million downloads of Groovy in the preceding year, as tangible proof that "Groovy is no small player in the field," regardless of its volatile TIOBE ranking.
