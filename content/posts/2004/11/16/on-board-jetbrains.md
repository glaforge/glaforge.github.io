JetBrains, JetBrains... You all know I love that company, and I love their products. Especially IntelliJ that I've using for a few years already as my main and primary Java IDE. That really, really rocks. And you've probably seen the picture of me wearing my [JetBrains TShirt](http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=85)...

So what's the news today? JetBrains's just released their [OnBoard monthly online magazine](http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/). That's worth a read! The featured articles are:

*   Language Oriented Programming: The Next Programming Paradigm
*   Applying Code Generation Approach in Fabrique
*   IntelliJ IDEA: Structural Search and Replace, What, Why and How-to
*   Extending Omea with New Resource Types

Of particular interest, Sergey Dmitriev's--long awaited for those in the know--article about Meta-programming: "[Language Oriented Programming](http://www.onboard.jetbrains.com/articles/04/10/lop/)". That's a real paradigm shift!

It's a pretty interesting vision. I'm really keen on small DSL languages for specialized domain models. Moreover, it's also interesting from the point of view of meta-programming. That rings a bell in my mind, since [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) supports some meta-programming facilities, like our builders for instance.

On a side note, unrelated to the OnBoard magazine, I'd like to say that JetBrains is very kind with Open Source projects. They've just granted [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) developers a license. A nice gift!
