This article details an ongoing community discussion regarding the potential code names for the next Early Access Program (EAP) cycle of IntelliJ IDEA, even as IntelliJ IDEA 4.0 itself is still within its current EAP phase. The debate is taking place on the IntelliJ forums, specifically in a thread concerning this very topic.

The piece presents a comprehensive list of suggested code names that have emerged from the community and internal discussions at JetBrains, often accompanied by brief explanations, origins, or critical commentary from the article's author. The proposed names range widely in their themes and derivations, reflecting diverse sources of inspiration and practical considerations:

*   **Mythological and Classical References:** A significant portion of the suggestions draw from mythology, historical figures, or celestial bodies. Examples include **StarGate**, **Atlantis** (described as a "mythological sunken island"), **Athena** (a Greek goddess), **Lachesis**, **Clotho**, and **Athropos** (identified as the three moirae or Fates), **Ananke** (meaning "necessity"), **Erebus**, **Dione** (another Greek goddess), **Aphrodite**, and **Adonis**. **Artemida** is also suggested, humorously linked to being a "tiger hunter" and, by extension, a "JDK 1.5 hunter." **Archimedes** is another classical figure proposed, though the author wryly notes it as "another sinking idea," possibly a playful jab related to Atlantis.
*   **Names with Linguistic or Geographic Significance:** **Avani** is suggested, noting its meaning as "earth" in some Indian languages. **Vedra** is mentioned "as in Vedra Valles," implying a geographical or astronomical reference.
*   **Internal and Personal Suggestions:** **Rhea** is highlighted as an internal suggestion from JetBrains employee Eugene Belyaev. The author of the article, for instance, put forward **Miranda**. Other personal or team-related suggestions include **Olesya** (named after a CVS integration developer), **Katja**, and **Laika** (referencing the first female dog in space).
*   **Names with Prior Usage or Pronunciation Concerns:** Several proposed names are immediately flagged due to potential conflicts or practical issues. **Stella** is dismissed because it was previously used for IDEA 2.0. **Avalon** is also deemed unsuitable due to its prior use by Microsoft for a new UI framework and by the Apache Avalon framework. The author notes **Aardvark** might be "too harsh to pronounce." The author's own suggestion, **Miranda**, is acknowledged to have been used by "Miranda-IM" and also carries a distinct association with the "Miranda warning" in the US legal system, which "reminds something to outlaws."
*   **Conceptual and Playful Names:** Some suggestions are more abstract or intended for humor. These include derivations of "Simple" such as **Simplex**, **Simplicity**, and **SimpleA**. **Revolution** is proposed, with a connection to the Aurora cruiser. More lighthearted suggestions include **Banana** (deemed "quite funny one") and **Donut** ("for hungry developers").

The author concludes the article by expressing personal preferences, stating a liking for their own suggestion, **Miranda**, but also favoring **Rhea** and **Ananke**, primarily because they "sound good." The article ultimately serves as an open invitation, concluding with a direct question to the reader: "What would you suggest?" thereby encouraging further community engagement in the code-naming process for the upcoming IntelliJ IDEA EAP cycle.
