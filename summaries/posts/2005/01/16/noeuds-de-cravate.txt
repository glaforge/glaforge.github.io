This article provides a comprehensive overview of various tie knots, emphasizing their importance for professional attire, particularly when starting a new job. The author begins by highlighting the necessity of being well-dressed, not just on the first day but consistently, and points out that a new job is an opportune moment to revisit classic sartorial elements, such as tie knots. Although the author often uses pre-knotted ties, the occasion of a new suit, shirt, and tie prompted a fresh look at tie-tying techniques.

The article asserts that most tie knots are not overly complicated, especially the classic "simple knot" (also known as "four-in-hand" in English). This knot is described as the most commonly used due to its ease of memorization and suitability for all types of ties, whether thin or thick. However, its primary drawback is a tendency to appear slightly crooked. While this effect might be less noticeable with very tightly tied or wide ties, the author suggests that more complex knots are generally preferred for their better hold and straight appearance. The caveat for these more intricate knots is that they are harder to remember and less suitable for short, thick ties.

The article then lists the most common tie knots:
*   The Simple knot (Four-in-hand)
*   The Double knot (also known as Double-simple or Prince Albert)
*   The Windsor knot
*   The Half-Windsor knot

Elaborating on these, the author explains that the Double knot is a variation of the simple knot, appearing slightly less oblique than its predecessor. It is well-suited for ties that are sufficiently long and not too thick. The knots belonging to the Windsor family (Windsor and Half-Windsor) are praised for their superior stability and absence of the slight crookedness associated with the simple knot. The author notes that these more complex knots are particularly effective with thin ties, as they can add significant volume and a touch of class to the knot.

Beyond these commonly known knots, the article expands its scope to include a broader range of "standard" tie knots, differentiating them from "fantasy" knots. The author explicitly states they will not discuss the bow tie but lists several other standard knots:
*   Plattsburgh (Dovorian)
*   Balthus (a derivative of the Plattsburgh)
*   Cavendish
*   Grandchester
*   Hanover
*   Oriental
*   Kelvin (a derivative of the Oriental)
*   Nicky
*   Onassis
*   Petit noeud (Small knot)
*   Pratt
*   Saint-Andrews
*   Victoria

In contrast to these standard knots, the article briefly mentions "fantasy" knots, which are designed to be more eye-catching and less likely to go unnoticed. Two examples provided are:
*   The Ascot
*   The Croisé (also known as Christensen or Prince Hugues)

The article concludes by recommending an external website where all the discussed knots are explained in detail with diagrams, making it a valuable resource for anyone wishing to reproduce them. The author advises readers to bookmark this "excellent site" for future reference.

In summary, the article serves as a comprehensive guide to tie knots, starting with the basic necessity of proper attire, detailing the characteristics and suitability of common knots like the Simple, Double, Windsor, and Half-Windsor, and then expanding to list many other standard and a few "fantasy" knots, all while providing a valuable external resource for practical learning.
