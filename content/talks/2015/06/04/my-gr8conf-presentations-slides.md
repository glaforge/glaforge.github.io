It's been a busy and intense week here at Copenhagen for [GR8Conf Europe 2015](http://gr8conf.eu/#/)! Great interactions and discussions with the Groovy community, and flawless organization.  

I had the chance to present three talks this year, and I'm embedding my slides below. First of all, I've given the usual Groovy keynote, with a Groovy state of the union.

Later on, I gave a talk on Groovy style! With interesting tips'n tricks, programming style advice.

Lastly, with my Web API hat on, I talked about various tools for creating and testing Web APIs.
