G2One and the Groovy development team have announced the release of the **first beta of Groovy 1.6**, highlighting a significant focus on performance improvements alongside new features and bug fixes. This beta version incorporates 73 bug fixes and 24 improvements.

The primary emphasis for Groovy 1.6-beta-1 has been on **performance enhancements**, a goal the development team has pursued diligently for the past 10 months.

**Compilation and Runtime Performance Improvements:**

*   **Compiler Speed:** The compiler in Groovy 1.6-beta-1, similar to Groovy 1.5.5, is now **3 to 5 times faster** than in earlier releases. This improvement benefits both the current development version and the 1.5.x stable branch. The increased speed is attributed to class lookup caches, which make compilation faster for larger projects.
*   **General Runtime Performance:** The most substantial improvements are found in Groovy's general runtime performance. Using benchmarks from the Great Language Shootout, the team measured **performance gains ranging from 150% to 460%** when compared to the current Groovy 1.5.6 stable release. While micro-benchmarks may not perfectly mirror real-world applications, a significant overall performance boost is expected for user projects.
*   **Historical Context and Technical Details:** The article notes that performance has been a continuous focus. Between Groovy 1.0 and 1.5.1, speed improvements of up to 80% were achieved on the same tests, with an additional 40% gain between dot releases (1.5.1 and 1.5.6). The latest, dramatic 150-460% speed increase in the development branch is attributed to the integration of advanced call site caching techniques and "bytecode diets" within the runtime.

**Important New Features:**

Beyond performance and bug fixes, two key new features are under development in Groovy 1.6:

*   **Multiple Assignments:** This feature allows for the convenient assignment of multiple variables from a list.
    *   Variables receive successive elements from the list.
    *   Variables for which no corresponding list element exists will be assigned `null`.
    *   If the list contains more elements than variables, the excess elements are not assigned.
    *   This syntax also provides a concise way to swap variable values. For example, `[a, b] = listOfN(1)` would assign `a = 1` and `b = null`; `[a, b] = listOfN(10)` would assign `a = 1` and `b = 2`; and `[a, b] = [b, a]` would swap their values.
*   **AST Transformations:** This is an advanced feature designed for developers familiar with Groovy's internals, but it enables practical benefits, particularly for Swing developers.
    *   It allows developers to "hook" into the compilation process, modifying the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) after the source code is parsed but before it is converted into JVM bytecode.
    *   These transformations are applied using annotations to decorate classes, fields, or methods.
    *   A concrete example is the new **`@Bindable` annotation**. When applied to a field (e.g., `class MyBean { @Bindable String pro }`), it transparently adds property change listener methods (like `addPropertyListener()`, `removePropertyListener()`, and code to fire property change events in setters) directly into the bytecode. This eliminates the need for developers to manually write this boilerplate code for monitoring field changes. Danno Ferrin's blog is referenced for more details on this. The article indicates that more useful transformations and annotations are planned for the future.

**Annotation Definition in Groovy:**

Previously, annotations in Groovy had to be defined in Java. Groovy 1.6 addresses this limitation, now allowing developers to **define annotations directly in Groovy** using the standard Java syntax.

**Noteworthy Remarks:**

*   Groovy 1.6-beta-1 is built against **JDK 5**.
*   The team plans to provide **JDK 1.4 "retro-translated" versions** of Groovy.
*   Users running on JDK 1.4 might not experience the same level of performance improvements, as some enhancements leverage JDK 5 specific optimizations (e.g., `util.concurrent` VM optimizations).
*   The bytecode generated by the Groovy compiler still targets the **1.4 JVM bytecode**, with the exceptions of annotations, enums, and generics.

**Conclusion and Call for Feedback:**

The development team expressed gratitude to all contributors, users, committers, and G2One employees for their hard work, specifically acknowledging Paul King, Danno Ferrin, Alex Tkachman, and Jochen "blackdrag" Theodorou.

They are actively seeking **feedback from users** on this beta release. Even if users prefer to stick with the stable 1.5.x branch for production, they are encouraged to test the 1.6-beta-1 in their projects and report any performance observations, problems, or regressions. Useful links for downloading the beta and accessing the release notes from JIRA are provided.
