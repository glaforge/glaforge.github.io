The article, penned by an individual who identifies as a "JetBrains fashion victim," provides a personal and detailed account of two recent and significant acquisitions: a long-awaited JetBrains T-shirt and a GMail account invitation.

The central narrative revolves around the author's receipt of a JetBrains T-shirt on a Saturday morning. Despite being awakened unusually early (around 8 o'clock) by the postman – an event initially met with annoyance, especially after a late night of coding in Groovy – the author soon remembered the reason for the potential delivery. This T-shirt was a promised item for members of "Team JetBrains," described as a "very private society of IntelliJ IDEA afficionados" to which the author belongs. The promise of these T-shirts had been made "long long ago," and their delivery had been plagued by significant delays due to JetBrains encountering issues with various T-shirt manufacturers they had contacted or contracted. Consequently, the members had largely given up hope, metaphorically referring to the T-shirt as their "Arlésienne" – a French idiom for something much discussed but never seen or materializing. Despite this, the community had previously received a Personal License for IntelliJ IDEA when the "Aurora" version was released, as a reward for their active participation in the Early Access Program (EAP). The article confirms that the T-shirt, pictured being proudly worn by the author, finally arrived, bringing an end to the long wait.

In addition to the T-shirt, the author recounts receiving a GMail account invitation during the same week, adding to the week's interesting events. This invitation was obtained through a "little game of magic number" organized by Alain Ravet. In this draw, both the author and Dmitry Lomov from JetBrains were the closest to the target magic number. The ultimate decision on the winner was left to Alain Ravet's dog, who chose Dmitry Lomov. However, the author was still able to secure a GMail account thanks to Robert Beeger, who had an additional invitation available and generously offered it to the author as the second-closest participant. The author expresses deep gratitude to both JetBrains for the T-shirt and to Robert Beeger for the GMail invitation.

The article concludes on a positive and appreciative note, with the author expressing satisfaction with his new possessions and wishing everyone a pleasant weekend, reinforcing his thanks to JetBrains.
