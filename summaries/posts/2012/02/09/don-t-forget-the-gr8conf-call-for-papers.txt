This article serves as an announcement for the upcoming GR8Conf, a prominent conference series dedicated to the Groovy ecosystem. The conference will be held in two separate locations: one in Denmark, catering to European attendees, and another in the USA. Both events are scheduled to take place "in a few months," indicating they are imminent.

The primary objective of GR8Conf is to provide a platform for the Groovy community to learn, engage, and collaborate. Attendees can expect to gain insights into the latest developments and novelties concerning a wide range of Groovy-based technologies. The article specifically lists several key technologies that will be covered, including Groovy itself, the Grails web framework, Gaelyk, the Gradle build automation tool, GPars for concurrency, the Griffon desktop application framework, the Spock testing framework, and CodeNarc for static analysis. This comprehensive coverage ensures that participants will be exposed to diverse facets of the Groovy ecosystem.

Beyond the technical learning aspect, GR8Conf is highlighted as the "best place" for community interaction. It offers a unique opportunity for attendees to engage directly with the Groovy community, meet the core developers behind these popular projects, and present their own success stories, thereby fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

A significant portion of the article is dedicated to an urgent Call for Papers (CfP). Individuals who are interested in speaking at the conference about any of the aforementioned Groovy-related topics are strongly encouraged to submit their proposals. However, a critical piece of information conveyed is the extreme time sensitivity of this call: there is "less than one week left" for potential speakers to submit their presentations. To facilitate submissions, the article provides direct links for each conference's CfP: [GR8Conf Europe Call for Paper](http://gr8conf.eu/cfp) and [GR8Conf US Call for Paper](http://gr8conf.us/Presentation-Proposal).

The article concludes with a personal expression of anticipation from the author, eagerly looking forward to seeing attendees at both GR8Conf events. In essence, the article functions as an informative event announcement, a detailed invitation to learn and connect within the Groovy community, and an urgent appeal for speaker submissions with a very short deadline.
