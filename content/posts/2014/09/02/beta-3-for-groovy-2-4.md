The Groovy development team is happy to announce the release of a third beta for Groovy 2.4.  

This release contains various bug fixes and minor improvements.  

I'll highlight the fact that you can now use multiple labels on your statements (instead of just one).  

With beta-3 now, many of the unneeded synthetic methods generated by Groovy are not generated anymore, reducing the number of methods nicely yielding smaller bytecode. This is of particular interest for Android developers limited in the overall number of methods used in Android applications.

You can read the [JIRA release notes](https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=20544) and go straight to the [download area](http://beta.groovy-lang.org/download.html)!
