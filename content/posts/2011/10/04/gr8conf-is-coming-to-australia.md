The now famous [GR8Conf](http://gr8conf.org) conference dedicated to all things [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org), is now [coming to Australia](http://www.gr8conf.org/blog/2011/10/04/111), as announced on the [GR8Conf blog](http://www.gr8conf.org/blog/list)! It will take place in Canberra, side by side with the [Open Source Developers Conference](http://osdc.com.au/) (OSDC), on November 15th.  

The [GR8Conf Australia website](http://gr8confau.org/) is already up and is running a Call for Papers. So if you have a presentation on Groovy, Grails, Griffon, Gradle, Spock, CodeNarc, Gaelyk, etc, with introductions, deep dives, case studies, and so on, feel free to submit a talk!
