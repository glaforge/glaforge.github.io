We're happy to announce the bug-fix release of Groovy 2.3.4.  

In store, we continued on our hunt of bugs related to anonymous inner classes, and we have a big work on the compatibility of our AST transformations with static compilation.  
[Download Groovy 2.3.4](http://beta.groovy-lang.org/download.html) from our [new website](http://beta.groovy-lang.org/):  

You can read the [JIRA release notes](https://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10242&version=20432).  

Thanks to all those who contributed to this release!  

Keep on Groovy-ing!
