This 74th edition of Groovy Weekly marks a significant milestone, having tracked over 3000 news items since its inception, and highlights a period of continuous activity and important developments within the Groovy ecosystem, even during the summer.

The most critical news in this edition is the release of **Groovy 2.4.4**, which marks its first version released under the Apache umbrella. This release is of paramount importance due to the immediate fix of an **important security issue** that affected Groovy 2.4.3 and all prior versions. The article strongly urges all Groovy users, as well as frameworks and libraries that utilize Groovy, to **upgrade to 2.4.4 as soon as possible**. This urgency is underscored by the fact that no older versions will receive the security patch, making an upgrade to 2.4.4 the sole solution to mitigate potential vulnerabilities from malicious attackers. The significance of this release was also covered by JaxEnter.

Beyond Groovy itself, several other key components of the ecosystem saw new releases:
*   **Griffon 2.3.0** was launched at GR8Conf Europe.
*   **Grails 3.0.3** was released, bringing notable improvements to its reloading capabilities.
*   **Geb 0.12.0** marked its 5th anniversary with a new release.
*   **Codenarc 0.24**, a static analysis tool for Groovy, also received an update.
*   **Deck2PDF 0.3** was released by Cédric Champeau, enabling the conversion of HTML/JavaScript presentations into PDF or images.
Many of these new versions, including Groovy 2.4.4, Grails 3.0.3, Vert.x 3.0, and Gradle 2.5, were made available on GVM (Groovy enVironment Manager), simplifying their adoption.

Community engagement and communication platforms are also evolving, with **Slack** emerging as a highly popular choice. Both the **Grails** and **Ratpack** frameworks announced the opening of their official Slack channels, with the Grails channel quickly attracting over 300 members, demonstrating a vibrant and active developer community.

A variety of **articles** provided practical insights and guidance for developers:
*   Ryan Vanderwerf detailed how to publish Grails 3 plugin snapshots to a local Artifactory server.
*   Jeff Beck explored the integration of JaCoCo for code coverage with Grails 3.
*   An article provided a first look at the new Android Gradle build tools, focusing on the new DSL structure and Gradle 2.5.
*   Benjamin Muschko offered advice on defining effective versioning strategies in Gradle.
*   Pavel Dudka shared a tip on ordering Gradle tasks.
*   R.D. Müller wrote about using the Spock-Reports plugin with Grails 3.

**Presentations** showcased real-world applications and advanced topics:
*   Bogdan Danilyuk presented on modularity with Grails, drawing from practical experience at TransferWise.
*   Benjamin Muschko delivered a presentation on advanced dependency management with Gradle.

**Tweets** offered a rapid-fire update of various news, opinions, and developments:
*   James Strachan, a co-founder of Groovy, asserted Groovy's role as "the language of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery," highlighting its utility with Jenkins Flow and Docker workflows.

Further news items included the regular **Grails Diary** entries by Jacob Aae Mikkelsen, covering weeks 25-28 and week 29, and the ongoing efforts by Mockito to bring better support for Groovy classes.

The Groovy ecosystem also continues to produce multimedia content, with Bertrand Goetzmann sharing a **screencast** of a lunar lander game developed using GroovyFX and JavaFX with reactive programming, and new episodes (15 and 16) of the **Groovy Podcast** being released.

In conclusion, this edition of Groovy Weekly paints a picture of a highly active and evolving ecosystem. The release of Groovy 2.4.4 under the Apache foundation, crucially addressing a security vulnerability, stands out as the most significant event, demanding immediate attention from all users. Concurrent releases across related frameworks and tools, coupled with a robust flow of articles, presentations, and active community discussions on new platforms like Slack, demonstrate strong momentum and continuous innovation within the Groovy, Grails, and Gradle communities.
