The article announces the release of **Groovy 1.6-RC-2**, the second release candidate for the upcoming major version Groovy 1.6. This announcement comes from the Groovy development team in collaboration with SpringSource.

The primary focus of Groovy 1.6-RC-2 is identified as a **bug fix release**. The development team highlights the significant amount of work undertaken, evidenced by the closure of nearly **100 JIRA issues**. This extensive bug-fixing effort underscores the commitment to ensuring a high-quality final Groovy 1.6 release. Beyond just bug fixes, the release candidate also incorporates various improvements. A specific enhancement mentioned is the "much nicer and thorough" output generated by **GroovyDoc**, which is expected to improve documentation quality for developers.

Furthermore, Groovy 1.6-RC-2 inherently includes all the **performance improvements and new features** that were previously introduced in the earlier beta and first release candidate versions. The announcement refers users to previous release announcements for details on these broader improvements, specifically citing:
*   **Groovy 1.6-beta-1**, which brought significant performance enhancements.
*   **Groovy 1.6-beta-2**.
*   **Groovy 1.6-RC-1**.

A crucial aspect of this announcement is a direct **call to action for the community**. The development team explicitly asks for user help to "test drive this release candidate." Users are urged to integrate Groovy 1.6-RC-2 into their existing projects to identify any potential critical bugs or regressions. The goal of this community testing is to ensure a smooth and timely upgrade path for users to the final Groovy 1.6 version as soon as it is released.
