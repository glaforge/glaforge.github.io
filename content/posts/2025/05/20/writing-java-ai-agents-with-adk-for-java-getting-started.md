At Google Cloud Next ‚Äò25, last April, Google released [Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) (ADK) for Python, a **flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents**.

Now at Google I/O, a **Java version of ADK** has been made available! And I‚Äôm glad to have had the chance to participate in its launch, via code samples, documentation, and helping shape the API so it‚Äôs idiomatic for Java developers.

In this article, my goal is to give you the basis to get started with the ADK framework, in Java, using the Gemini model, and running your first Java agents locally.

## Project structure

Create a usual Java project structure like the following, with your Java sources in `src/main/java`:

```
[YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]/
 ‚îî‚Äî‚Äî pom.xml
 ‚îî‚Äî‚Äî src/
     ‚îî‚Äî‚Äî main/
         ‚îî‚Äî‚Äî java/
             ‚îî‚Äî‚Äî agents/
                 ‚îî‚Äî‚Äî ScienceTeacherAgent.java
```

Let‚Äôs have a look at a minimal `pom.xml` to compile and run your agent:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>adk-agents</groupId>
    <artifactId>adk-agents</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

    <dependencies>
        <!-- ADK core dependency -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
            <artifactId>google-adk</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <!-- ADK dev web UI and API server -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.google.adk</groupId>
            <artifactId>google-adk-dev</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>

```

You just need a couple of dependencies:

- the Core ADK framework dependency, and
- the ADK web server that provides a nice and useful Dev UI to interact with your agents, as well as an API server.

## Your first agent

Now that the project is set up, let‚Äôs implement a very simple agent. It‚Äôll be a single agent. And it won‚Äôt yet use tools to interact with the external world. We‚Äôll explore multi agents and tool support later on, in more advanced articles.

So let‚Äôs have a look at a science teacher agent, whose role is to help kids and teenagers understand scientific concepts in a friendly and approachable way.

Here‚Äôs the full source code. You can expand this block to see it all, but we‚Äôll explain everything further down, in a piecemeal fashion.

{{< details summary="Click to see the full source code" >}}

```java
package agents;

import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;
import java.util.Scanner;

import com.google.adk.agents.BaseAgent;
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.events.Event;
import com.google.adk.runner.InMemoryRunner;
import com.google.adk.sessions.Session;
import com.google.genai.types.Content;
import com.google.genai.types.Part;

import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Flowable;

/** Science teacher agent. */
public class ScienceTeacherAgent {

    public static BaseAgent ROOT_AGENT = initAgent();

    public static BaseAgent initAgent() {
        return LlmAgent.builder()
            .name("science-app")
            .description("Science teacher agent")
            .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
            .instruction("""
                You are a helpful science teacher that explains
                science concepts to kids and teenagers.
                """)
            .build();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(ROOT_AGENT);

        Session session = runner
                .sessionService()
                .createSession(runner.appName(), "student")
                .blockingGet();

        try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in, UTF_8)) {
            while (true) {
                System.out.print("\nYou > ");
                String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
                if ("quit".equalsIgnoreCase(userInput)) {
                    break;
                }

                Content userMsg = Content.fromParts(Part.fromText(userInput));
                Flowable<Event> events =
                    runner.runAsync(session.userId(), session.id(), userMsg);

                System.out.print("\nAgent > ");
                events.blockingForEach(event -> {
                    System.out.println(event.stringifyContent());
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

{{< /details >}}

So what does the simplest agent look like?

```java
LlmAgent.builder()
    .name("science-app")
    .description("Science teacher agent")
    .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
    .instruction("""
        You are a helpful science teacher that explains
        science concepts to kids and teenagers.
        """)
    .build();
```

An agent consists of a name, a description, a model, and some instructions, and that‚Äôs it! In other articles, we‚Äôll also see how to give it tools, how to use state, how it can interact with other agents and workflows, but for now, let‚Äôs stick with this simple science teacher agent.

## Running your agent

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve saved the above agent in a `ROOT_AGENT` static field of your class (it‚Äôll come in handy for the Dev UI later on). Now we need to instantiate a _runner_ and a _session_ to run the agent.

First, you instantiate an `InMemoryRunner` with your agent:

```java
InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(ROOT_AGENT);
```

Then you create a session with the `SessionService` that you can grab from the runner itself (passing an application name and user ID):

```java
Session session = runner
        .sessionService()
        .createSession(runner.appName(), "student")
        .blockingGet();
```

Now, if you want to have a familiar chatbot-like experience, you‚Äôll loop over and alternate between user provided messages, and LLM generated answers. Let‚Äôs use a `Scanner` to get the input from the user, inside a big `while` loop, and send the user‚Äôs prompt to the LLM agent, via runner‚Äôs `runAsync()` method, passing the session and the message. The agent will reply with a flow of events that we can then print:

```java
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in, UTF_8)) {
    while (true) {
        System.out.print("\nYou > ");
        String userInput = scanner.nextLine();
        if ("quit".equalsIgnoreCase(userInput)) {
            break;
        }

        Content userMsg = Content.fromParts(Part.fromText(userInput));
        Flowable<Event> events = runner
            .runAsync(session.userId(), session.id(), userMsg);

        System.out.print("\nAgent > ");
        events.blockingForEach(event -> {
            System.out.println(event.stringifyContent());
        });
    }
}
```

## Define environment variables

You‚Äôll need to export two environment variables:

- a Gemini key that you can [get from AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key),
- a variable to specify you‚Äôre not using Vertex AI this time.

```shell
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDF...
```

In this article, let‚Äôs use the Google AI / DeepMind endpoint and API key for Gemini, but you can also use Gemini from Google Cloud Vertex AI.

## Executing the agent from the command line

From the command line, let‚Äôs use Maven‚Äôs exec java plugin to launch this science teacher agent:

```shell
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="agents.ScienceTeacherAgent"
```

Let‚Äôs see the output when asking a simple question about _‚Äúqubits‚Äù_!

You > What is a qbit? Please answer in a concise manner.

Agent > Hey there, future tech wiz! üëã

A **qubit** (short for "quantum bit") is the basic unit of information
in a quantum computer. Unlike a regular bit in your computer, which is
either a 0 or a 1, a qubit can be a 0, a 1, or *both at the same time*
thanks to something called **superposition**! This "both at once"
ability is what makes quantum computers super powerful for certain
kinds of problems.

And the conversation can go on and on, till you‚Äôre bored and you enter _‚Äúquit‚Äù_ to end the chat.

## Executing the agent in the Dev UI

ADK comes with a Dev web UI (and API server) that you can use to run your agents, see how they behave, the data they exchange, how they interact with the underlying LLM. So let‚Äôs talk about this.

The following Maven command will launch the Dev UI:

```shell
mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
    -Dexec.classpathScope="compile"
```

**Note**: You can add a different path or even use a sub-directory (if you want to expose only agents in a certain package) by adding and customising this flag: `-Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java/com/foo/agents"`.

This time, you run the `AdkWebServer` class from the second dependency (`google-adk-dev`). There‚Äôs one constraint currently for the Dev UI to grab and run your agents: they have to be statically initialized and stored in a `public static BaseAgent ROOT_AGENT` field. That‚Äôs why the class had the following structure:

```java
public class ScienceTeacherAgent {
    public static BaseAgent ROOT_AGENT = initAgent();

    public static BaseAgent initAgent() { ... }
}
```

To access the Dev UI, just head over to your browser and open the following URL: http://localhost:8080/dev-ui

You should see something similar to this:

![adk-dev-ui-science-teacher.png](/img/adk/adk-dev-ui-science-teacher.png)

- You can **select an agent** from the loaded agents in the top left hand corner.
- When clicking on the **events**, you can see the popup over the left pane that shows all the details of the events that are flowing through, as well as the **input request** and **output response** from the LLM.
- On the right side, in the chat area, you can see the **dialogue** between the user and the AI, as well as potential **tool calls**.
- You can also **enable token streaming** at the top of the screen with the slide if you want to see responses being streamed as they are generated by the model.

## Congratulations!

Wait, what? Are we already done?
Yes, you‚Äôve coded and executed your first Java agent with the ADK framework!

## Now what?

Many possible next steps, and also pointers, that I‚Äôd like to share with you.

- First of all, read the [article announcing the launch of Java ADK](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/agents-adk-agent-engine-a2a-enhancements-google-io/?utm_campaign=CDR_0x7a40493f_default_b418955413&utm_medium=external&utm_source=blog), and other news related to [Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview?utm_campaign=CDR_0x7a40493f_default_b418955413&utm_medium=external&utm_source=blog), and [A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) (Agent to Agent Protocol).
- Think about how you can integrate such an agent inside an existing Java application that you want to enhance with advanced agentic capabilities.
- You may want to [deploy an agent on Cloud Run](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/cloud-run/), for example, or host it anywhere else you‚Äôd like, as it‚Äôs just an open source framework not tied to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?utm_campaign=CDR_0x7a40493f_default_b418955413&utm_medium=external&utm_source=blog).
- Start [learning more](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) about the concepts behind the framework, and what it‚Äôs capable of.
- Check out the [source code on Github](https://github.com/google/adk-java).
- I‚Äôd like to invite you to look at more substantial [examples](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/java/snippets/src/main/java) and [samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/java) than my science teacher.
- My colleague Abi implemented a [patent research and analysis agent](https://medium.com/google-cloud/build-powerful-stateful-ai-agents-in-java-with-agent-development-kit-adk-0f7e2cd3d094) in Java, with ADK, deployed on Cloud Run, with data on AlloyDB.

I‚Äôm really looking forward to hearing from you about what you‚Äôll be building with ADK for Java! You can expect many more articles on this blog on the topic of ADK. So stay tuned!
