A few months ago, I had some fun doing the keynote of Voxxed Days Singapore and JUG Summer Camp, and I realized I didn't get a chance to share my deck. Furthermore, the videos of both events are actually available online: one in English, one in French!

I spoke about the so-called IT Holy Wars, you know, like Vi vs Emacs, Tabs & Spaces, or other funny things of that kind. How developers circle from client-side to server-side, how we are polarized across strong positions on certain frameworks or practices, on clean vs ugly code, on tooling (build, front, back), dark / light background themes for your IDE, how do you format dates, and more.

I had lots of fun preparing and delivering this talk, both in English and French.

Let's start with English deck & video:
