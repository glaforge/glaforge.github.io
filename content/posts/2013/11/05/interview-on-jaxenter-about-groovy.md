Following up my [presentations from JAX London]({{< ref "/talks/2013/11/04/groovy-presentations-at-conferences" >}}), I was interviewed about Groovy for JAXenter, with questions about what Groovy brings to Java developers, the recent surge in popularity as [Groovy broke the TIOBE index top 20 languages]({{< ref "/posts/2013/10/11/groovy-enters-top-20-of-the-tiobe-language-index" >}}), my favorite projects in the Groovy ecosystem.
