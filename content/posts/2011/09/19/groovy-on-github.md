Groovy completed successfully its move to the Git SCM this summer, thanks to [Matthew](http://ambientideas.com/)'s help. For helping everybody get up-to-speed with Git, I've added a [page about Git on the Groovy wiki](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Git).  

We also now have a **"groovy" organization on GitHub**: [https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core)  

Our three main branches have been pushed there: master, `GROOVY_1_8_X` and `GROOVY_1_7_X`. But I've not pushed the tags though.  

The **GitHub repository serves as a mirror**, and the Groovy despots will be able to regularly push the latest changes to GitHub, and deal with pull requests and such.  

**Update #1:** The branches as well as all the tags have been pushed to the GitHub mirror as well.  

**Update #2:** We've even had our first pull requests! Hooray :-)
