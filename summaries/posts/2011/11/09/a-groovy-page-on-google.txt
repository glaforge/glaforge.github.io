The article announces a significant development in how the Groovy project will engage with its community, spurred by the recent release of Google+'s new "page" feature. The author reports that, in response to Google+'s rollout of this new functionality, a dedicated Google+ page has been created for the Groovy project.

The core motivation behind establishing this page is to provide a consistent and centralized source of information and interaction for those interested in or using Groovy. Specifically, the author intends to utilize the Groovy project Google+ page to share "regular updates" about the project itself. This encompasses not only news directly related to the Groovy language and its development but also broader happenings within its "ecosystem," suggesting updates on related tools, libraries, community initiatives, and other pertinent developments.

Furthermore, the page will serve as a curated resource, sharing "any interesting article that's of interest to those using Groovy." This indicates an effort to bring valuable external content to the attention of the Groovy community, helping users stay informed about relevant trends, tutorials, or discussions across the web.

In essence, the article highlights a proactive move to leverage Google+'s evolving social platform to enhance communication, foster community engagement, and disseminate information and curated content to Groovy users and enthusiasts. The initiative aims to create a more dynamic and accessible channel for the Groovy project to connect with its audience, providing a new avenue for staying abreast of project news, ecosystem developments, and valuable external resources. The article provides direct links to Google's announcement of the "page" feature, the newly created Groovy project Google+ page, and the main Groovy project website for further context.
