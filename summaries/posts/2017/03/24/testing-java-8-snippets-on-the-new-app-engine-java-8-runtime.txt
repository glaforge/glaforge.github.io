This article announces the imminent arrival of a Java 8 runtime for Google App Engine standard, which is currently in alpha testing, and provides resources for developers to explore its capabilities.

The core announcement is that a new **Java 8 runtime for Google App Engine standard** is "coming soon" and is currently undergoing **alpha testing**. Developers interested in hands-on experience can request to join this alpha program.

To facilitate experimentation for a wider audience, the author has developed and launched a **specialized web console**, accessible at `cafe-huitre.appspot.com`. This console serves a dual purpose: it allows users to easily try out new **Java 8 APIs** and experiment with **Java 8 syntax**.

The article clarifies that this web console is, in fact, a specially adapted version of the author's existing **Groovy Web Console** (`groovyconsole.appspot.com`), which is typically used for writing, executing, and saving Apache Groovy snippets. The key distinctions of this particular version are:
1.  It is **built on Java 8** itself.
2.  It utilizes the **`invoke dynamic`** feature.
3.  Crucially, it incorporates the **"Parrot" parser**. This "Parrot" parser is a significant feature as it adds the **Java 8 syntax constructs to the Groovy grammar**. This means the console not only provides an environment for testing Java 8 snippets but also offers a unique opportunity for developers to preview the **future Groovy parser**, which is slated for release in either Apache Groovy 2.5 or 3.0.

In addition to the technical preview, the article also announces a **GDG Cloud meetup in Paris**, scheduled for **Tuesday, April 4th**. This event is strategically timed to precede Devoxx France. The meetup will feature **Ludovic Champenois**, a Google engineer working on App Engine, who will be in France and will speak specifically about **Java 8 on Google App Engine**. Attendees interested in learning more about this topic are encouraged to sign up.

The author of the article will also be presenting at this same meetup. His presentation will cover broader Google cloud and AI technologies, including **Google Home, Google Assistant, API.AI, and Google Cloud Functions**. He will demonstrate how these technologies can be leveraged to host the logic for custom bots and agents, basing his talk on a presentation he previously delivered at Cloud Next 2017 in San Francisco.

In summary, the article acts as a multi-faceted announcement: highlighting the impending Java 8 runtime for App Engine, providing an innovative web-based tool for immediate experimentation that also previews future Groovy features, and promoting an in-person event where these and related technologies will be discussed in detail by Google experts.
