Congrats to the GrooScript team with the [GrooScript 1.0](http://grooscript.org/announcement.html) release! With GrooScript, if you will, you can have a full Groovy experience, from the build (Gradle), backend (Groovy, Grails, Ratpack), mobile (Groovy on Android), up to the front-end web layer with Groovy translated into JavaScript!

Another impressive and widely acclaimed release is the [first milestone of Grails 3](https://github.com/grails/grails-core/releases/tag/v3.0.0.M1)! You can have a look at the [novelties in Grails 3](http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/3.0.x/guide/introduction.html#whatsNew), and watch a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aro3_RZqgtU) about it.

The Ratpack team has also been pretty busy with [Ratpack 0.9.13](http://www.ratpack.io/versions/0.9.13), with over 17k lines of code changed in this release!

Guillaume Laforge also announced that [Groovy was downloaded over 4 million times from Maven Central](https://twitter.com/glaforge/status/562590782084112384), without even counting the downloads of the binary distributions from Codehaus or Bintray. In total, Groovy will likely be beyond 5 million times in total, compared with 3 millions the past year.
