The article directly addresses and vehemently refutes persistent rumors and perceptions regarding the "death" of the Groovy programming language. The author notes that prominent figures in the community, such as "Mike" and "Cédric," have contributed to this narrative, with some even questioning the "final date for the burial" of the project.

The author acknowledges the immense pressure and exceptionally high expectations placed upon the Groovy open-source project by its users and the broader blogosphere, suggesting that few other OSS projects face such scrutiny. While conceding that Groovy might have appeared somewhat "zombie-like" about six months prior, the author firmly asserts that this is no longer the case, citing a significant uptick in development activity in recent months. Despite this renewed vigor, the article admits that the project's public relations efforts are currently lacking and require substantial improvement.

To provide a clear counter-narrative and outline the project's future, the article details a provisional roadmap for the coming months. While precise, definitive dates are difficult to commit to due to limited resources, a general timeline is presented. The plan includes the release of beta-10 within two weeks of the article's publication. Approximately one month after beta-10, a new version, jsr-1 (formerly known as beta-11), is slated for release, which will introduce an optional new parser. Subsequent "jsr-x" versions are then planned to utilize this new parser by default. The author identifies June as a "plausible target date" for the final Groovy 1.0 release, though this target is explicitly qualified by the project's resource availability. To enhance transparency and manage community expectations, the author also suggests publishing a detailed roadmap page on the official Groovy website.

A key technical development highlighted in the article is the significant progress on a new parser for Groovy. The initial grammar was developed by John Rose using Antlr, based on a diff against a Java 1.3 grammar. Jeremy Rayner subsequently ported this grammar to be compatible with Java 1.5. Most notably, in the week preceding the article's writing, James Strachan made rapid progress in integrating this new grammar and parser into the Groovy runtime. The author confidently predicts that users will be able to experiment with this "New Groovy" within approximately a month and a half. Despite this swift advancement, the author candidly acknowledges that there are still "a few rough edges" and "heaps of work to do." Specific areas requiring further development include the builders, refining the semantics of method invocation and scoping rules, and ensuring a coherent implementation of closures' logic. Despite these remaining challenges, the author expresses optimism, stating that these tasks are "doable."

In conclusion, the article unequivocally rejects the notion that Groovy is "dead." Instead, it presents a compelling case for the language's vitality through evidence of ongoing significant technical development, a clear future roadmap, and a commitment to addressing existing challenges, all while acknowledging past perceptions and the need for improved public relations.
