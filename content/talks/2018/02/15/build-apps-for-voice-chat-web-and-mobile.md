**ServerlessConf Paris** is in full swing this week, and I had the chance yesterday to participate in a workshop with my colleague Frank, to cover building apps for voice, chat, web and mobile, using Google's serverless [solutions. In particular, for voice & chat, I spoke about Dialogflow and Google Assistant / Actions](https://developers.google.com/actions/) on Google, using [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) for my business logic, while in the afternoon we covered [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) un more depth.

If you want to have a quick look at the deck, here are the slides that I presented:
