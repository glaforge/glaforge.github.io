With my friend [Paul King](https://plus.google.com/105508550588099229829/about), we ran our [Groovy Domain-Specific Languages](http://www.slideshare.net/glaforge/groovy-dsls-from-beginner-to-expert-guillaume-laforge-and-paul-king-springone2gx-2011) talk again this year in Chicago, for the [SpringOne2GX conference](http://springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/2gx/event_sessions). I've uploaded the slides on Slideshare, and Paul has pushed the [examples on Github](https://github.com/paulk-asert/DSLsFromBeginnerToExpert). The room was packed, and we had lots of fun doing our little dialogue between the customer and Groovy DSL developer, improving our DSLs, showing new techniques along the way, to suit the requirements as they evolved.
