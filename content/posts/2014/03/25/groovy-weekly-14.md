## Tweets

*   Dierk König says it's at the same time nice and weird to see [Java developers now being able to enjoy the benefits that Groovy has provided for the past 10 years](https://twitter.com/mittie/status/446292208048943104) already

## Google+ posts

*   Richard Vowles [notes that with the latest IntelliJ IDEA 13.1 release, for your projects using the Maven Eclipse Groovy compiler](https://plus.google.com/u/0/+RichardVowles/posts/PNMikyJ6jYS), there's no need anymore for the Eclipse Groovy plugin, as IDEA recognizes the Maven layout properly now out of the box.
