This article provides a comprehensive summary of the notable developments, releases, and discussions within the Groovy ecosystem during the week of early March 2015. The overarching theme is the significant intention of the Groovy project to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), marking a pivotal moment for the language.

**Major Announcements and Strategic Moves:**
The biggest news highlighted is the formal intention of the **Groovy project to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)**. This strategic move was announced by Guillaume Laforge, an influential figure in the Groovy community, and was subsequently covered by John K. Waters of ADTMag, who published a follow-up article based on an interview with Laforge. Complementing this, Cédric Champeau, another prominent contributor, provided an in-depth **analysis on who has contributed to Groovy** over the years, offering valuable insights into the project's community backbone.

**New Releases Across the Ecosystem:**
The week saw several important software releases:
*   **GMavenPlus 1.5** was released.
*   **GrooScript 1.0.1** and its associated **GrooScript Gradle plugin 1.0.1** were made available.
*   **Android-Spock 1.2** was released, notably now working with Spock 1.0.
*   **GVM (Groovy enVironment Manager) 2.3.0** introduced a new "outdated" command, designed to help users identify if newer candidates are available for their installed tools.

**In-depth Articles and Technical Discussions:**
A wide array of articles provided technical insights and updates:
*   **Groovy's Future & Language Design:** Beyond the ASF announcement, Jochen Theodorou initiated a discussion on the path towards a revamped Meta-Object Protocol (MOP) for Groovy, indicating ongoing language evolution. Cédric Champeau also contributed new official documentation on Groovy meta-annotations.
*   **Gradle and Build Tools:** MrHaki offered practical tips in his "Awesome Asciidoctor" series, demonstrating how to use inline extension DSL with Gradle, and in "Gradle Goodness," explaining how to define system properties in `gradle.properties`.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA Enhancements:** JetBrains announced new features for Gradle coming in IntelliJ IDEA 14.1, detailed by Andrey Cheptsov, and Peter Gromov highlighted faster Groovy compilation capabilities in the same IDE version.
*   **Web Frameworks and Libraries:**
    *   An article explored **Groovy, GrooScript with React.JS**, showcasing integration.
    *   Marcin Zajączkowski provided a detailed **comparison of Spock 1.0 with Groovy 2.4 configurations in Maven and Gradle**.
    *   Benoît Hédiard guided readers on **how to publish Grails 3 plugins to Bintray**.
    *   The Ratpack team offered more information on **how their documentation works** and how code samples are tested.
    *   Several Grails-specific tips were shared, including rendering errors of multiple beans (Albert van Veen), getting Groovy with JRebel and Grails (Adam Koblentz), working with SASS scripts in Grails 2.3 (Mansi Arora), customizing Grails test reports (Igor Shults), and an alternative method for admin screens (Mike Hostetler).
*   **Groovy Language Specifics:** Ken Kousen provided a practical tip on passing closures as method arguments in his article "If a method arg is a closure, for crying out loud pass it a closure."

**Community News and Updates:**
*   The **GVM project reached 400 stars on GitHub**, signifying growing community recognition.
*   Cédric Champeau authored new official **documentation on Groovy meta-annotations**.
*   Kunal Dabir released **Directree**, a simple DSL designed for creating directory trees and files.
*   An **updated roadmap for GrooScript** was published, including plans for require.js support.
*   Jacob Aae Mikkelsen shared his **Grails Diary for week 10 of 2015**.

**Social Media Highlights (Tweets):**
Twitter buzz included:
*   Confirmation that **Dagger 2 would work with Groovy sources and Gradle 2.4**, thanks to efforts by Luke Daley and Will Erickson.
*   Cédric Champeau documented how to **use closures as annotation parameters**.
*   A humorous tweet from Cédric Champeau admitting to confusing the "Apache Software Foundation" (ASF) with the "AST" acronym (likely due to his work on Groovy's Abstract Syntax Tree transformations).
*   David Dawson praised the **experience of using Reactor with Groovy for data processing**.
*   Dan Woods reminded the community about the **Ratpack forum** for support.
*   Tim Yates light-heartedly shared a picture of "Groovy biscuits."

**Code Snippets and Event Announcements:**
*   Practical code examples were shared, including how to use **RxJs with GrooScript** and a Groovy script by Iván López to **generate HTML for Greach conference speakers pages**.
*   Finally, **GR8Conf Europe 2015 announced its first batch of speakers**, building anticipation for the upcoming event.

In conclusion, the article paints a picture of a vibrant and evolving Groovy ecosystem in early March 2015, dominated by the strategic move towards joining the Apache Software Foundation, supported by a flurry of new releases, detailed technical articles, and active community engagement.
