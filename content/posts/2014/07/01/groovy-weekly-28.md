A big week for the Gradle team as they’ve just announced the final release of Gradle 2.0! It’s of course a very important milestone for the project, and it’s nice to see that the migration to Groovy 2.3 as a baseline.

There are also some updates to Grails, Ratpack, and also the launch of the Spring IO platform that you might be interested in.

You’ll see also a list of job postings for Netflix, where Groovy is deployed at a very large scale and who are always seeking Groovy talents.
