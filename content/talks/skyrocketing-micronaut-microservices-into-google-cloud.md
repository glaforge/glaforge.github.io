Instead of spending too much time on infrastructure, take advantage of readily available serverless solutions. Focus on your [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) code, and deploy it rapidly as a function, an application, or within a container, on Google Cloud Platform, 
with [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), 
[App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine), 
or [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run).

In this presentation, you’ll discover the options you have to deploy your Micronaut applications and services on Google Cloud. With [Micronaut Launch](https://micronaut.io/launch/), it’s easy to get started with a template project, and with a few tweaks, you can then push your code to production.

Thanks to its performance, its low memory consumption, and its lightning-fast startup time, Micronaut is particularly well-suited for services that run on serverless solutions.
