Monday I'll be flying to San Francisco for the JavaOne conference, where there will be [tons of sessions and BOF speaking about Groovy](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww?event=javaone#loadSearch-event=javaone&searchPhrase=groovy&searchType=session&tc=0&sortBy=titleSort&p=&i(11424)=&i(10050)=&i(10090)=&i(10092)=&i(11842)=&i(10086)=) or mentioning it, and where I'll be participating at two sessions, one of the novelties of Groovy 2 and the ScriptBowl.  

Let me highlight a few of those sessions:  

*   [What's new in Groovy 2](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6505)  
    Shameless plug, that's my session, where I speak about some of the key features of Groovy 1.8, and then quickly delve into the major features of Groovy 2
*   [What's new in Grails 2](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7945)  
    Graeme Rocher will cover and demo the key features of Grails 2.x

    Again, Andres on stage here, to speak about the many projects built atop Groovy, for your build, for testing and more
*   [Walk through Groovy's AST transformations](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5102)  
    Andres walks us through Groovy's mechanism to plugin into the compiler to bring powerful compile-time metaprogramming abilities to your classes

    Venkat Subramaniam revisits classical design patterns as well as new ones

    The CERN research center (the great hadron collider, etc) talk about their usage of Groovy and Grails, with concrete examples, screenshots and more
*   [GroovyFX: making JavaFX Groovy](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=2813)  
    Jim Clarke and Dierk talk about the GroovyFX library, a thin DSL on top of JavaFX to express your creativity with JavaFX in a nice Groovy idiom
*   [Grezi and GroovyFX](https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=5486)  
    Bertrand Goetzmann and Stephen Chin speak about GroovyFX and show a concrete usage with the Grezi framework, to build powerful visual and interactive presentations

    I'll finish with the ScriptBowl, a friendly 2-round battle comparing some of the popular languages of the JVM platform. Hopefully, I'll try to win again this year, but the competition is tough! Fingers crossed! Come in number to support me and make Groovy win again!
