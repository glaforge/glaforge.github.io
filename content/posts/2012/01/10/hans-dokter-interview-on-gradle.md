While at the [Groovy/Grails eXchange conference]({{< ref "/posts/2011/12/17/videos-and-slides-of-groovy-grails-exchange-2011" >}}) in London last month, I had the pleasure and honour to interview [Hans Dockter](http://gradleware.com/team), creator of [Gradle](http://gradle.org) and CEO of [GradleWare](http://gradleware.com/). This [interview was recorded](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/interview-on-gradle/js-3210) and published by [SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com/).  

Here's a list of questions I had the chance to ask Hans:  

*   What's Gradle?
*   Any new about Gradle 1.0 and what's being worked on?
*   Why is Gradle using Groovy for its DSL?
*   Is it possible to enforce conventions and standards à la Maven?
*   Some words on IDE integration, roadmap, etc?
