With Google+ releasing its new ["page" feature](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/google-pages-connect-with-all-things.html), I've created a [page for the Groovy project on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101432359761228268146/posts). The idea is to post some regular updates on what's going on in the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org) project, its ecosystem, and share any interesting article that's of interest to those using Groovy.
