[RebelLabs](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/) launched an annual study and awards to select 10 "kick-ass" technologies that developers love, and both Gradle and Groovy were among the winners!

You can learn more about this ["kick-ass" technology study](http://pages.zeroturnaround.com/Kickass-Technologies.html) in the PDF report they crafted and which can be downloaded there (form filing required to download the PDF).

Details are available for:

*   [Groovy](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/4/)
*   [Gradle](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/3/)

It's always nice to see such reports and awards recognizing the great work and energy the Groovy and Gradle teams have been put into developing those technologies, and making developers around the world delighted to work with them.
