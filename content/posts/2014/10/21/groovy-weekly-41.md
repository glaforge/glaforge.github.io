Along with some valuable releases like the first release candidate of Gradle 2.2, there are interesting links on the topic of the Groovy Android story, as well as new glimpse on AST macros and AST pattern matching coming up. Worth a look!

In terms of events, the Greach conference in Spain has opened its Call for Paper, and the GR8Conf Europe crew reminds us that all the great content from the last edition is freely available on their YouTube channel.
