Direct live from [GR8Conf Europe 2016](http://gr8conf.eu/#/), in Copenhagen, Denmark! This morning, I presented my latest [update about the Apache Groovy history, and the latest developments](https://speakerdeck.com/glaforge/a-groovy-journey-in-open-source-land) in the 2.4.x and future 2.5 branches.  
Abstract:  

> In dog years... err... Open Source years, the Groovy programming language project is a very mature and successful one, as its 12 million downloads a year can attest. The Groovy language is certainly the most widely deployed alternative language of the JVM today. But how do we go from a hobby night & week-end project to professionally company sponsored? And back again to hobby mode but joining the wider Apache Software Foundation community?  
>
> Guillaume will guide you through the history of the project, its latest developments, and its recent news, outlining the importance of a community around an Open Source project.  
>
> Also, we'll discuss what it means to contribute, when it's your hobby or as a paid committer -- what does it change? What it means to join the Apache community, what the impact of professional Open Source is, and more.

And here are the slides:
