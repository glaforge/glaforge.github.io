Busy conference times:

Greach is over, but we’re lucky to get the next batch of presentations and videos online on the [Greach Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGreachChannel).

The [GR8Conf Europe](http://gr8conf.eu/) early bird price has been extended for another week.

And Cédric and myself (Guillaume) are heading to the Devoxx France conference to speak about Groovy and Gradle.

While at the same time, the Groovy team is delivering [a new beta for the lovely Groovy 2.3]({{< ref "/posts/2014/04/10/second-beta-for-groovy-2-3" >}}) release.

Busy times, I tell you!
