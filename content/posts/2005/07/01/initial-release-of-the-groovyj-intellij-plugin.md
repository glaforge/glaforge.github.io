Franck Rasolo, our IntelliJ expert, just released and announced the inital version of the GroovyJ IntelliJ IDEA plugin!

> The Groovy team is pleased to announce the first public release of GroovyJ, a plug-in that integrates the Groovy language into IntelliJ IDEA.
> 
> You may browse the current [GroovyJ status page](http://groovy.codehaus.org/GroovyJ+Status) which lists the features shipped with this initial release.
> 
> In a nutshell, with GroovyJ:
> 
> *   a default Groovy runtime is automatically installed as a global library
> *   Groovy files can be edited with some amount of syntax highlighting
> *   'Run Configurations' can be created for runnable Groovy scripts
> *   Groovy scripts can be run with the output being captured in the embedded console window
> *   Groovy scripts located under module source/test folders will be automatically compiled when compiling modules
> 
> Note: This plug-in is available through IDEA's plug-in manager and requires IntelliJ IDEA 5.0 build #3378 or higher.
