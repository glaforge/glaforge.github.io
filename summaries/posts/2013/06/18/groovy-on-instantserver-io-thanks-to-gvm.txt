This article details a practical guide on how to set up a Groovy development environment on a temporary Ubuntu server provided by InstantServer.io, a service that offers short-lived Amazon EC2 instances for testing purposes.

The author begins by introducing InstantServer.io as a convenient service that allows users to instantiate an Ubuntu server on Amazon EC2 for a duration of 35 minutes. The process is straightforward: users click a button, and the service provides an account, password, and SSH connection details. A notable observation made by the author is that the service seems to be experiencing high demand, leading to increasing delays in server provisioning, suggesting it is a victim of its own success.

The core idea behind the article is to leverage these temporary servers for installing and launching Groovy using GVM (Groovy enVironment Manager). However, the author immediately identified two initial hurdles: the standard Ubuntu server provided by InstantServer.io lacks the `unzip` command and a pre-installed Java Development Kit (JDK), both of which are prerequisites for installing GVM and Groovy.

Fortunately, the author acknowledges that Tim Yates had already published detailed instructions addressing these challenges, simplifying the author's task. The article then proceeds to present these instructions step-by-step, making it easy for readers to follow along.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the installation process:

1.  **Server Instantiation and Login**: The first step involves creating a new instant server via the InstantServer.io website and then logging into it using the supplied username and password via SSH.
2.  **Install Unzip**: Since GVM relies on `unzip` to decompress downloaded archives, this command must be installed first. The instruction provided is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install unzip
    ```
3.  **Install OpenJDK and Set JAVA_HOME**: Groovy requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or JDK to run. The article instructs users to install `openjdk-7-jre-headless`, a lightweight JRE suitable for server environments, and then set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to its installation directory. The command for this is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
    ```
4.  **Install GVM**: With the prerequisites met, GVM can now be installed. The standard installation script for GVM is used:
    ```bash
    curl -s get.gvmtool.net | bash
    ```
5.  **Source GVM Initialization Script**: After GVM is installed, its initialization script needs to be sourced into the current shell session to make GVM commands available. The path specified is:
    ```bash
    source "/home/ubuntu/.gvm/bin/gvm-init.sh"
    ```
6.  **Install Groovy with GVM**: Finally, Groovy itself can be installed using GVM, which handles downloading and setting up the correct Groovy version:
    ```bash
    gvm install groovy
    ```
7.  **Test Groovy Installation**: To confirm that Groovy has been successfully installed and is functional, a simple test command is provided:
    ```bash
    groovy -e "println 'Hello'"
    ```
    This command executes a simple Groovy script that prints "Hello" to the console.

In conclusion, the article provides a clear, concise, and highly practical guide for quickly setting up a functional Groovy development environment on a temporary Ubuntu server. It highlights the utility of InstantServer.io for rapid testing and demonstrates how to overcome common initial setup challenges by installing necessary tools like `unzip` and OpenJDK, before proceeding with the installation of GVM and Groovy itself. The detailed, step-by-step instructions, directly credited to Tim Yates, ensure that users can easily replicate the process.
