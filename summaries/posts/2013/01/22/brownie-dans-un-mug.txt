The author begins by recounting how they stumbled upon a list of "life-hacks" on Facebook, many of which were quite clever. Among these practical tips, they discovered the concept of a brownie recipe designed to be cooked quickly in a mug. Intrigued, the author then sought out the specific recipe, finding an initial version on a blog (gopromos.com) and subsequently discovering other variations, including one from the well-known chocolate brand Lindt.

Driven by a desire for a gourmet treat and to delight their daughter, the author decided to combine elements from these various recipes to concoct their own unique version. The article then proceeds to share this personalized recipe, emphasizing its ease and speed of preparation.

**The Ingredients for the Author's Brownie in a Mug are as follows:**

*   8 squares of dessert chocolate (specified as approximately 1/4 to 1/5 of a standard chocolate tablet)
*   1 spoonful of butter
*   3 tablespoons of water
*   4 tablespoons of flour
*   3 tablespoons of sugar
*   1 pinch of salt
*   2 walnuts (for an added crunch)

**The Preparation Process is Straightforward and Microwave-Friendly:**

1.  **Initial Melting:** The first step involves placing the chocolate squares, butter, and water together at the bottom of a mug. This mixture is then microwaved for approximately 30 seconds to melt the chocolate and butter thoroughly.
2.  **Mixing the Batter:** Following this initial melting, the dry ingredients—flour, sugar, and a pinch of salt—are added to the mug. The contents are then vigorously stirred to ensure a homogeneous mixture, forming the brownie batter.
3.  **Adding Crunch (Optional):** As a special addition for texture, the author suggests incorporating two walnuts into the mixture at this stage, providing a pleasant crunch.
4.  **Final Cooking:** Finally, the mug containing the complete batter is returned to the microwave for "une bonne minute" (a good minute) to cook the brownie to perfection.

The article concludes by highlighting the simplicity and speed of this "life-hack" recipe, promising a delicious, warm brownie ready in just minutes with minimal effort, making it a perfect quick indulgence or a fun activity to share, as the author did with their daughter.
