First of all, let me wish you a very Groovy year! May 2015 fulfill all its promises, keep you healthy, bring joy and hapiness around! And of course, may it be filled with tons of bits of Groovy code!

Following up my plea for [more stars on Github](https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core), we went from below 600 stars to beyond 1000! But we don’t need to stop there, so let’s keep starring and spreading the word!

Another thousand milestone reached with the 2000th news item delivered in Groovy Weekly this week!
