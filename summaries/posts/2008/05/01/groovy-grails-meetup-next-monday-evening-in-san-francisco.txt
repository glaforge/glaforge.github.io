This article serves as an announcement and invitation to a free Groovy/Grails meetup hosted by G2One, specifically targeting attendees of the JavaOne conference who are interested in these dynamic JVM languages and frameworks.

The event is scheduled for Monday evening, commencing at 7:00 PM. While the article mentions "Monday 5th," implying a specific date relevant to the JavaOne schedule, it does not specify the month or year. The chosen venue is the W Hotel, strategically located directly across the street from the Moscone Center, making it easily accessible for conference-goers. A key aspect highlighted is that participation in this meetup is entirely free of charge.

The meetup is presented as a valuable opportunity for attendees to engage directly with the individuals behind the Groovy programming language and the Grails web framework. The initial segment of the evening, lasting approximately an hour and a half, is packed with content. This includes keynotes that will provide the latest news and updates regarding both projects. Attendees will also have the chance to witness various "cool demos" showcasing the capabilities and practical applications of Groovy and Grails. Furthermore, the agenda features testimonials from customers who have successfully adopted Grails in their own projects, offering real-world insights and success stories.

A unique draw of the event is the opportunity for attendees to meet and get their books signed by prominent authors in the Groovy ecosystem. Specifically, Venkat Subramaniam, known for "Programming Groovy," and Scott Davis, author of "Groovy Recipes," will be present.

Following this initial session, the event will include a break where complimentary drinks and appetizers will be provided, fostering networking opportunities. After the break, the gathering will transition into an "NFJS meeting" (referring to No Fluff Just Stuff), which will feature an "interesting panel discussion." The specific topic of this panel is not detailed in the article.

To conclude, the article reiterates the core information: a free Groovy/Grails meetup taking place on Monday 5th at 7 PM at the W Hotel, across from Moscone.
