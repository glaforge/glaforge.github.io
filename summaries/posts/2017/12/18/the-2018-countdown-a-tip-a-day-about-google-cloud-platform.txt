The article details the recent launch and ongoing development of a new blog, `googlecloud.tips/`, which is exclusively dedicated to sharing tips and tricks related to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The author initiated this blog "a few weeks ago" prior to the article's publication, with the primary goal of compiling and disseminating insights gathered from personal explorations of the platform, discoveries of new products, and accumulated experience with various GCP services.

A significant current initiative highlighted in the article is a "2018 countdown" approach. This concept functions similarly to an advent calendar, albeit without any religious connotations. Under this scheme, a new GCP tip is published *every day* throughout the month of December. As of December 18th, the specific date of the article's writing, the blog had already accumulated and published 18 distinct tips.

The content of these tips is diverse and wide-ranging, covering approximately a dozen different technologies within the Google Cloud ecosystem. To facilitate navigation and discovery, readers can explore the tips via "tags," with each tag representing a specific technology, service, API, or product, allowing for targeted browsing.

Initially, the author anticipated that maintaining a daily publishing schedule, especially considering weekends, holidays, and potential vacations, would present a considerable challenge. However, they discovered that there is actually an abundance of practical tricks and insights available to share. Furthermore, the blog has been opened to community contributions, welcoming anyone interested in contributing a tip or two by simply sharing a brief gist describing their insight. This call for contributions has been remarkably successful, with the author having already received numerous tips from eight distinct contributors. The article specifically acknowledges and thanks Alexandre, Bastien, Fabien, Graham, Jim, Mark, Victor, and Wassim for their valuable input.

Looking beyond the current "2018 countdown," the author explicitly states that the blog's activity will not cease. While the daily frequency might decrease post-December (potentially to once a week or a similar schedule), there is a strong commitment and intention to continue sharing GCP tips on a regular basis throughout the coming year and in the future.

To foster growth and engagement, the author concludes with several calls to action. Readers are encouraged to "spread the word" about `googlecloud.tips/` among their friends and colleagues. They are also urged to follow the dedicated Twitter account, `@GcpTips`, where announcements of new tips and tricks are made. Finally, and crucially, the author extends an open invitation for individuals to "share your own tips," emphasizing that all forms of help and contributions are warmly welcomed.
