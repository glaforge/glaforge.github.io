with tons of tabs for each window. But there are always apps I come back to very often,
like my email (professional & personal), my calendar, my chat app, or even social media
sites like Mastodon or Twitter. You can switch from window to window with CTRL/CMD-Tab,
but you also have to move between tabs potentially. But for the most common webapps or
websites I‚Äôm using, I wanted to have a dedicated desktop application.</p><p>Initially, I was on the lookout for a Mac specific approach, as I‚Äôve been a macOS users
for many years. So I found some Mac-specific apps that can handle that. This website mentions
<a href=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/website-desktop-mac-app/>5 approaches for macOS</a>, including
free, freemium, non-free apps, like Fluid, Applicationize (creating a Chrome extension),
Web2Desk, or Unite. However, some of them create big hundred-mega wrappers. Another approach
on Macs was using Automator, to create a pop-up window, but that‚Äôs just a pop-up, not a real app.
There are also some promising open source projects like <a href=https://tauri.app/>Tauri</a>
and <a href=https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier>Nativefier</a> which seem promising.</p><p>Fortunately, there‚Äôs a cool feature from Chrome, that should work across all OSses,
and not just macOS. So if you‚Äôre on Linux or Windows, please read on.
The websites you‚Äôll turn into applications don‚Äôt even need to be PWAs (Progressive Web Apps).</p><p>Here‚Äôs how to proceed:</p><p>First, navigate to your website you want to transform into an application with your Chrome browser.</p><p>Click on the triple dots in the top right corner, then More Tools, and finally Create Shorctut:</p><p><img src=/img/chrome-to-app/web2app-01-create-shortcut.png alt></p><p>It will then let you customise the name of the application.
It‚Äôll reuse the favicon of the website as icon for the application.
But be sure to check ‚ÄúOpen as window‚Äù to create a standalone application:</p><p><img src=/img/chrome-to-app/web2app-02-open-as-window.png alt></p><p>Then you‚Äôll be able to open the website as a standalone application:</p><p><img src=/img/chrome-to-app/web2app-03-standalone-app.png alt></p><p>I was curious if a similar feature existed with other browsers like Firefox.
For the little fox, the only thing I could find was the ability to open Firefox in kiosk mode,
in full-screen. But I wanted a window I could dimension however I wanted, not necessarily full-screen.
I hope that Firefox will add that capability at some point.
But for now, I‚Äôm happy to have this solution with Chrome!</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/calculating-your-potential-reach-on-mastodon-with-google-cloud-workflows-orchestrating-the-mastodon-apis/>Calculating your potential reach on Mastodon with Google Cloud Workflows orchestrating the Mastodon APIs</a></li><li><a href=/posts/turning-a-website-into-a-desktop-application/>Turning a Website Into a Desktop Application</a></li><li><a href=/posts/apis-we-have-a-problem-json/>APIs, we have a Problem JSON</a></li><li><a href=/posts/workflows-tips-and-tricks/>Workflows Tips and Tricks</a></li><li><a href=/posts/retrieve-youtube-views-count-with-youtubedl-jq-and-a-docker-container/>Retrieve YouTube views count with youtubeDL, JQ, and a Docker container</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><div class=social><a href=https://uwyn.net/@glaforge><img src=/img/icons/mastodon-black.svg alt="Mastodon logo" width=42px></a>
