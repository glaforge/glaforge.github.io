Today is the 8th birthday of the [Groovy dynamic language](http://groovy.codehaus.org) project!  

I hardly believe I've been involved with the project for almost as long! I started contributing to the project very early, but only became committer 4 months or so later. It's been such a great fun, great ride, meeting all those great persons, and seeing the community forming around the project, and further along, the wealth of satellite projects!  

There are still so many good things ahead of us, but we already have a solid, healthy, successful and popular project project, and that's also thanks to all our users, and those who contributed in a way or another. So thanks to you all for all those great years!  

Keep on groovy'ing!
