This article details an interim initiative to update the visual appearance of the official Groovy website (groovy.codehaus.org) while the Groovy team prepares for a more comprehensive and professional overhaul in the near future.

The author explains that in the coming months, the dedicated Groovy team will be collaborating with a professional web designer to develop a completely new, improved website. A significant part of this future project will involve creating better and up-to-date documentation, which is expected to be a time-intensive effort, particularly concerning the content rather than just the aesthetic design.

However, recognizing the need for an immediate improvement to the site's aesthetics, the author undertook a personal project to refresh the existing website's look as an interim measure. This immediate refresh involved the author spending "several hours" manipulating CSS3. For the structural and stylistic elements, the author leveraged Twitter's Bootstrap grid system. This system was chosen for its ease of use, robust grid capabilities, and its comprehensive features that manage typography, menus, and other essential UI components. Furthermore, for enhancing the presentation of code snippets on the site, highlight.js was integrated. This particular tool was selected for its effective Groovy syntax highlighting capabilities, a feature the author already utilizes on their personal blog.

The article then presents a visual representation of the updated website design, indicating the direct outcome of these CSS3 and tool-based modifications. The author concludes with a modest disclaimer, stating explicitly that they are "not a professional web designer," which contextualizes the nature of this interim design effort. In essence, the article highlights a short-term visual update for the Groovy website, executed by a team member, using modern web development tools, as a bridge to a much larger, professionally-led redesign project focused on both aesthetics and content.
