This article details a significant proposed integration between Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Java and the LangChain4j project. The author, a recognized contributor to the LangChain4j project with experience in areas like Gemini support and GCS document loaders, identifies a crucial limitation of the current ADK for Java: its restrictive support for Large Language Models (LLMs). Currently, ADK for Java officially supports only Gemini and Claude models, a stark contrast to its Python counterpart which offers broader model compatibility through LiteLLM integration.

The core argument for this integration is to drastically expand the range of LLMs accessible to Java agents built with ADK. By leveraging LangChain4j's extensive ecosystem, which includes integrations with models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and various local models runnable via Ollama (such as Gemma, Qwen, and Phi), ADK for Java would gain the ability to utilize a much wider variety of generative AI models. This would provide developers with greater flexibility in choosing the most suitable model for their specific agent tasks, considering factors like cost, performance, and local execution capabilities.

The author explicitly states that this integration is a "work-in-progress" and a "glimpse" into ongoing development, collaboratively undertaken with Dmytro, LangChain4j's founder. It currently exists as a Pull Request (PR #102) against the ADK GitHub project and has not yet been officially integrated into either ADK or LangChain4j. The article serves as an early preview, promising further updates upon its official availability.

The proposed solution involves creating a `LangChain4j` ADK model adapter. This adapter allows developers to configure any `ChatModel` or `StreamingChatModel` instance provided by LangChain4j and wrap it, making it seamlessly compatible for use within an ADK `LlmAgent` instance.

The article provides several concrete examples to illustrate the versatility and power of this integration:

1.  **Using Local Ollama Models in ADK:**
    Developers can easily configure ADK agents to use local LLMs served via Ollama. An example demonstrates building an `LlmAgent` that utilizes a "Qwen 3:1.7b" model running locally on `http://127.0.0.1:11434`. This is achieved by creating an `OllamaChatModel` instance and wrapping it with the `LangChain4j` adapter. A screenshot further illustrates the ADK Dev UI successfully interacting with a locally served Gemma 3 model, highlighting the capability to run agents with privacy-focused or cost-effective open-source models directly on a developer's machine.

2.  **Using Big Provider Models in ADK:**
    Beyond local models, the integration extends to major commercial LLM providers.
    *   **Anthropic Models:** The article provides code for configuring an `AnthropicChatModel` (e.g., Claude 3 Sonnet) by supplying an API key and model name, then wrapping it for ADK use.
    *   **OpenAI Models (including Streaming):** An example shows how to integrate an `OpenAiStreamingChatModel` (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). The article also addresses streaming functionality in the ADK Dev UI. To fully support both streaming and non-streaming modes via the UI's toggle switch, developers would configure two separate `LangChain4j` models within the `LlmAgent` builder: one for streaming and one for non-streaming.

3.  **Integrating Tools and Multi-Agent Scenarios:**
    A significant advantage of this integration lies in ADK's native support for tools. If the underlying LangChain4j model supports function calling, ADK agents will automatically be able to utilize tools. The article highlights the particularly interesting concept of an agent acting as a tool for another agent. This enables complex multi-agent architectures where different LLMs can be strategically combined. An illustrative example showcases a main agent (configured with Claude) utilizing an `AgentTool` which wraps a "weather-agent" (configured with an OpenAI streaming model). This design allows developers to employ a "best model for the job" approach, potentially using a super-fast, lightweight model for simple classification or request routing, while reserving a more powerful and capable model (like Gemini 2.5) for complex reasoning or primary tasks.

In conclusion, the article emphasizes that while still in its nascent stages, this proposed integration is a powerful development for Java AI agent creation. It represents a substantial way to expand ADK for Java's model compatibility to include a much wider array of options, including both commercial and local open-source LLMs. Furthermore, it unlocks "interesting perspectives" for designing sophisticated multi-agent systems where diverse LLMs can collaborate effectively, each playing to its strengths. The author commits to keeping the community informed about the progress of this promising development.
