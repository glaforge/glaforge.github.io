For the second Groovy Weekly column, on the eve of a new year, I’d like to wish you a very Groovy year, and share with you the following links, hoping you’ll have some spare time to look into them while you’re celebrating.

Releases

*   A new project appeared on the Groovy ecosystem radar: Grain, [announced](http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/ANN-Grain-0-5-0-released-td5717888.html) by Victor Vlasenko on the Groovy mailing-list. [Grain](http://sysgears.com/grain/) is a promising lightweight and yet powerful static website generator for Groovy which purpose is to make demanding site implementation an intuitive and enjoyable. Grain framework is equally well-suited for any static website, whether it is a complex and sophisticated company site or a simple and neat blog. The framework applies elegant website building concepts and allows to develop rapidly by making and seeing changes on the fly.
    
*   Kunal Dabir created a [Lazybone template for creating Groovy libraries](https://github.com/kdabir/lazybone-templates/blob/master/templates/groovy-lib/README.md) readily publishable to Bintray, CI with Travis-CI, with a Gradle build and wrapper, a .gitignore file and more.
    
*   Last week we mentioned the release of CodeNarc 0.20, and the associated [CodeNarc Eclipse plugin](http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/ANN-Announcing-Eclipse-CodeNarc-Plugin-0-20-0-td5717876.html) has also been released
    
*   Andrés Almiray released [Gipsy](https://github.com/aalmiray/gipsy), an AST transformation to simplify the use of the Service Provider Interface, similar to the [Jipsy](https://github.com/aalmiray/jipsy) annotation processing toolkit he also created:
    
*   Stergios Papadimitriou shares with us his project, [GroovyLab](https://code.google.com/p/jlabgroovy/), a MATLAB-like environment for the Java Virtual Machine. GroovyLab is an open source project based on the Groovy language. GroovyLab is efficient and can be an interesting open-source alternative to commercial packages, especially for the scientific community familiar with Java. The article introduces the architecture of GroovyLab and presents some examples of using GroovyLab to do useful work.
