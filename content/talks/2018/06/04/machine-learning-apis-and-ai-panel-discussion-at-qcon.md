Last March, I had the chance to attend and speak at [QCon London](https://qconlondon.com/london2018/schedule/london2018/tabular.html). I spoke at the event for its first edition, many moons prior, so it was fun coming back and seeing how the conference evolved. 

This year, [Eric Horesnyi](https://twitter.com/erichoresnyi) of [Streamdata](https://streamdata.io/) 
was leading the Artificial Intelligence track, and invited me to speak about Machine Learning.

First, I gave an overview of the Machine Learning offering, from the off-the-shelf ready-made APIs like 
[Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), [Speech](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/), 
[Natural Language](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/), [Video Intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/). 
I also mentioned [AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl/), 
to further train existing models like the Vision model in order to recognize your own specific details in pictures. 
For chatbots, I also covered [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/). 
And I said a few words about Tensorflow and [Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) 
for training & running your [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) models in the cloud.

Eric hosted a panel discussion with all the speakers in the AI track, where we discussed many interesting topics, 
to demystify AI and answer questions from the audience. Click on the picture below to watch the panel discussion:
