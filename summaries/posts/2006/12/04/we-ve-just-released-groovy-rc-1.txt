This announcement details the release of **Groovy RC-1 (Release Candidate 1)**, marking a pivotal moment in the project's development. This release is highlighted as an "important milestone," signifying that the final **Groovy 1.0 version is imminent**, with the ambitious plan for its official launch before the end of the current month.

A cornerstone of this RC-1 release is the **re-implemented and extensively reworked Meta-Object Protocol (MOP)**. The MOP is fundamental to Groovy's runtime system, dictating how method calls, property access, and attribute access are dispatched. This significant internal overhaul aims to provide **greater flexibility and finer-grained control** over these core mechanisms. While a substantial architectural change, the author notes that these specific MOP improvements will primarily affect developers needing to tweak advanced dispatching logic, and thus, may not impact the typical user directly.

Beyond this architectural enhancement, Groovy RC-1 incorporates a substantial number of fixes and improvements, with **approximately one hundred bug fixes and various other enhancements** worked into this version. Several key improvements are specifically highlighted:

1.  **Enhanced and Customizable Coercion Mechanisms:** The ability to coerce types has been significantly improved. Developers can now customize coercion for their own Plain Old Groovy Objects (POGOs) using the `asType(Class)` method. Furthermore, the language now supports coercing `Maps` to interfaces and `Closures` to single-method interfaces, expanding the flexibility of dynamic type conversions.
2.  **'in' Keyword as a Full Boolean Operator:** The 'in' keyword, previously primarily associated with `for` loops, now functions as a fully supported boolean operator, allowing for more intuitive and readable conditional expressions outside of loop contexts.
3.  **Dynamic Method Invocation with GStrings:** Groovy's dynamicity is further extended by allowing developers to decide which method to call using GStrings. An example provided is `foo."$methdName"(*args)`, which permits dynamic method dispatch based on a variable holding the method name.

Crucially for developers, RC-1 marks the definitive end of a transition period for certain deprecated syntaxes. The **old closure notation with the vertical pipe** (e.g., `{ |arg| ... }`) and the **`@Property` syntax** (which was silently ignored in previous releases) are now both **"definitely illegal."** The announcement emphasizes the expectation that users will have already updated their codebases to reflect these changes.

For a comprehensive breakdown of all bug fixes and improvements, users are directed to the project's JIRA release notes. Groovy RC-1 is available for download at the usual distribution location.

The announcement concludes with heartfelt gratitude to the entire Groovy team for their dedicated efforts. Specific individuals and groups are recognized for their significant contributions: Jochen Theodorou for his hard work, John Wilson for the XML support and the MOP, Guillaume Alléon for patches and Groovy SOAP, Dierk Koenig and his co-authors for the "Groovy in Action" book, and the Eclipse plugin team. Appreciation is also extended to the new committers, such as Paul King, who have brought fresh perspectives and helped improve critical error messages. The author acknowledges that the list of contributors is extensive and thanks everyone involved.
