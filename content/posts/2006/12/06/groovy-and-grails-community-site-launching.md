All about [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and [Grails](http://grails.org/) on a dedicated community news site! Soon to be launched!

Yes, you read it. There's going to be a site devoted to everything [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and Grails! The news is unleashed, on the streets. At the time of this writing, the site isn't up yet, but there's a countdown telling us there's still 1 day and 16 hours left before [http://aboutgroovy.com](http://aboutgroovy.com/) is open. It will be online just before the start of the [Spring Experience conference](http://www.thespringexperience.com/speaker_view.jsp?speakerId=728) taking place in Hollywood, Florida. I'll be speaking there by the way: I'll be presenting [Grails](http://grails.org/) and along with Rod Johnson, we'll explain how integrating Spring and [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) together.

On the Groovy mailing-lists, Scott Davis spoke a bit about [http://aboutgroovy.com](http://aboutgroovy.com/) saying it'll be a dedicated news site, much like Digg, [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/groovy) or Slashdot.

Scott told us that this site will:

*   spotlight strong blogs like [CodeForFun](http://codeforfun.wordpress.com/) or [Craig Walls](http://jroller.com/page/habuma/20061127) -- of Spring in Action fame
*   cover corporate articles like the ones from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/grall-grails.html) and [BEA](http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2006/10/introduction-groovy-grails.html)
*   publish tutorials (Scott Hickey has a nice three article series on bootstrapping a Groovy+Java project with Ant, JUnit, and [Cobertura](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Code+Coverage+with+Cobertura))
*   PDF chapters from Graeme's excellent book: [The Definitive Guide to Grails](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-Grails-Graeme-Rocher/dp/1590597583), and the equally excellent [Groovy in Action](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Groovy-Action-Dierk-Konig/dp/1932394842/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_b/026-7604440-4591668)
*   offer links to screen casts, podcasts, and video interviews

If you're speaking at a JUG, or if you are working for a company that uses Groovy/Grails extensively and would like to be featured in a case study, they'll be happy to interview you. You'll also be able to submit links, write articles, tips'n tricks, cool hacks, you name it.

Icing on the cake: [http://aboutgroovy.com](http://aboutgroovy.com/) is built on Grails 0.3.1! As Scott told us, they're drinking the kool-aid, and it seems pretty tasty!
