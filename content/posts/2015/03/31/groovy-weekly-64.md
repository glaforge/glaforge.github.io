Today marks the [end of the sponsorship of the Groovy and Grails projects by Pivotal](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/the-groovy-project-is-looking-for-a-new-home). The projects are now turning a new page in their lives. For Groovy, the project is going to wear some feathers, with [joining the Apache Software Foundation](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/groovy-project-joins-apache-software-foundation/2015/03/27). And Grails is [releasing its major 3.0 version](http://grails.io/post/115110650393/grails-3-0-released-and-the-road-ahead).

With Groovy’s move to Apache, it’s important to notice that the Groovy mailing-lists are moving. You [must subscribe to the new mailing-lists at Apache](http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/IMPORTANT-New-mailing-lists-and-JIRA-migration-td5723329.html), as we won’t force-subscribe people, so you’ll have to opt-in to these new lists.

Last but not least, Groovy has been submitted for nomination for the JAX 2015 innovation award, so we encourage you to [vote for Groovy for the JAX innovation award](http://jaxenter.com/jax-awards-2015/submit-your-vote)!
