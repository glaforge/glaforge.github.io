This article, a "Groovy Weekly" update, provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments, community activities, and upcoming events within the Groovy ecosystem. It highlights Groovy's increasing popularity and strong community engagement, while also noting a brief upcoming slowdown in the weekly publication schedule due to the author's vacation.

**Overall Sentiment and Recognition:**
The article opens by emphasizing Groovy's strong standing among developers, recalling its selection alongside Gradle in RebelLabs' report as one of the "10 kick-ass technologies developers love." This sentiment is further cemented by the announcement that Groovy recently won the "Geek Choice Award," underscoring its appeal within the developer community.

**Conferences and Educational Content:**
A significant portion of the update focuses on the wealth of content emerging from **GR8Conf US 2014**. The conference is generating "tons of great videos and materials" from its speakers, which are being progressively released on YouTube and GitHub. A particular highlight recommended by the author is the Q&A talk by Scott Hickey and Jim McGill, offering a retrospective on "9 years of using Groovy at a big US insurance company," providing valuable real-world insights.

Key presentations from GR8Conf US 2014 that are now available or forthcoming include:
*   A look back at "9 years of Groovy at the Mutual of Omaha insurance company."
*   The popular "Groovy Puzzlers" talk by Baruch Sadogursky and Andrés Almiray.

Both Grails 2.4.3 and Groovy 2.4.0-beta-2 are now available via GVM. The Ratpack project is actively publishing its test coverage and seeking community assistance to improve it, also reminding users about its dedicated forum for support. The ongoing growth of Griffon plugins is also noted.
