Although on a more irregular schedule, Groovy Weekly continues in the summer with its 74th edition, crossing the bar of the 3000 total news items tracked since it all started!

Some interesting releases for this edition, like the [Groovy 2.4.4](http://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-2.4.4.html) release under the Apache umbrella! After a failed attempt, our second try was succesful, and it was particularly important to get it right out the door, as an [important security issue](http://groovy-lang.org/security.html) uncovered was fixed in this release, and all Groovy users (and frameworks and libraries using Groovy) should upgrade as soon as possible — especially as no older version will be released with the patch.

In the release section, last time, I had forgotten [Griffon 2.3.0](http://griffon-framework.org/releasenotes/griffon_2.3.0.html) which was released on stage at GR8Conf Europe by Andrés Almiray. And in other releases, we also have [Grails 3.0.3](https://twitter.com/grailsframework/status/619082386320572416) with important reloading improvements, [Geb 0.12.0](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/geb-user/2LXtg0pP4Do) which celebrated its 5th anniversary, and also [Codenarc 0.24](https://github.com/CodeNarc/CodeNarc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) that I had forgotten the previous edition as well.

It looks like Slack is really becoming very popular as both [Grails](https://twitter.com/grailsframework/status/621780975870152704) and [Ratpack](https://twitter.com/ratpackweb/status/621103100619681792) opened Slack channels!
