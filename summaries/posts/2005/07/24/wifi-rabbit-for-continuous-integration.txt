The article expresses the author's keen interest in acquiring a "Wifi rabbit" known as the Nabaztag. This gadget is described as a 23-centimeter tall white rabbit, notable for its movable ears and a set of multi-colored flash LEDs. Its core functionalities include the ability to be paired with another Nabaztag, allowing their ears to mirror each other's movements even if located in different towns or countries, provided a permanent DSL connection is maintained. Beyond this interactive feature, the Nabaztag can also sing songs and, through optional service subscriptions, react to real-world data like stock market trends or weather conditions, such as flashing yellow when the sun is shining.

The author then connects the Nabaztag's capabilities to the field of software development and continuous integration. This connection was inspired by a recent OSS-GT meeting, which included presentations on Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) by Alexandre Vasseur and CruiseControl by Jérôme Lacoste. These discussions reminded the author of Mike Clark's book, "Pragmatic project automation," which suggests using "lava lamps" as a visual indicator for build failures in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.

Drawing from Clark's concept, the author proposes a practical application for the 95-euro Nabaztag. Given its documented ability to react to specific emails containing particular keywords, the author suggests configuring the Nabaztag to indicate the status of a project build. The proposed mechanism is for the rabbit to glow red upon a build failure and green upon a successful build, thereby serving as an immediate and ambient visual alert for development teams.

The article concludes by highlighting the appealing "geek gadget" nature of the Nabaztag and mentions discovering numerous other similar items on the French-language "Mageekstore." Examples of these other quirky tech products include a USB/MP3 player watch, various USB lights, Swiss army knives with integrated USB keys, and a USB coffee mug warmer, all of which contribute to the author's sentiment of there being "too many funny toys" available for technology enthusiasts.
