After some trouble getting to San Francisco because of strikes, transportation issues, burnt control tower, and more... I managed to land to JavaOne! I missed my own first talk and I was glad and grateful that Cédric could present it for me.

At JavaOne, the Groovy project received the award from ZeroTurnaround / RebelLabs, for the "Best Tech - Geek Choice Award" :

> Youpi mon projet a reçu un prix de l'innovation ! Très fier de ce que mon équipe a accompli !

And at the famous "Script Bowl" competition, I managed to get on the first place of the podium, along with the Clojure representative, showing Groovy traits, Groovy on Android, and GrooScript transpiling Groovy into JavaScript.
