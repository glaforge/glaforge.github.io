The article, written by an individual deeply involved in the Java and open-source communities, serves as a personal update detailing three significant recent developments in their life: a marriage, a major professional appointment related to Groovy, and an upcoming speaking engagement at a prominent Java conference.

Firstly, the author shares the personal news of their recent marriage. Just one week prior to the article's publication, they wed the "lovely woman" with whom they had been living for several years. The celebration was a joyous occasion, attended by family and friends. Notably, "Tug," a friend and active Groovy committer, traveled from England to attend the wedding and captured a series of photographs of the couple, which are linked within the article. The author expressed sincere gratitude to all who came to celebrate this happy moment and to those who sent their best wishes.

Secondly, the author announced a significant professional advancement: their nomination as the Spec Lead for JSR-241. This new leadership role comes with a clear and ambitious vision for the future of the Groovy programming language. The author expresses a strong hope that under his guidance, and coinciding with the impending release of Groovy 1.0, Groovy will achieve recognition as the de facto and enterprise standard scripting language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Furthermore, he speculates about the ambitious possibility of Groovy's inclusion in Java 7, drawing a parallel to the JDK 6 decision to bundle Derby as a precedent for integrating additional technologies. This highlights a strategic intent to elevate Groovy's standing and integration within the broader Java ecosystem.

Finally, the author outlined an upcoming professional commitment: his participation in the JavaDay 2006 conference. This event is scheduled for a Thursday (implied to be soon after the article's publication) and will take place in Versailles, France. The author will be a speaker in a session titled "Xwiki, Hibernate, Groovy, ... The French Java OpenSource Vitality." This session is designed to showcase the vibrant French Java open-source scene, featuring numerous French contributors from the OSS-GTP group who are active committers to various renowned open-source projects, each speaking about their respective 'pet' projects. Beyond his individual session, the author is also slated to participate in a high-profile "Round Table - JavaOne 2006: Ask The Experts" alongside James Gosling, a highly respected figure in the Java community. The author concludes by expressing his anticipation for the conference and looking forward to engaging with attendees there.

In summary, the article functions as a comprehensive update, blending celebratory personal news of a recent marriage with exciting professional milestones, including a new leadership role for a key Java specification and significant contributions to upcoming Java community events, underscoring the author's active and influential presence in the Java and open-source world.
