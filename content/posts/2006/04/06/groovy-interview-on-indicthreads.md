After my [interview](http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=138) back in august 2005, I'm happy to let you know about my [latest interview](http://www.indicthreads.com/interviews/429/groovy_grails_scripting_enterprise_java.html) I've just made for [IndicThreads](http://www.indicthreads.com/). In this interview, I'm speaking of course about [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and [Grails](http://grails.codehaus.org/), our innovative and advanced web framework lead by [Graeme Rocher](http://graemerocher.blogspot.com/).
