My buddy [Wassim](https://twitter.com/manekinekko) and I were back on stage together to talk about chatbots, 
with [Actions on Google](https://developers.google.com/actions/) and [Dialogflow](https://twitter.com/manekinekko), 
at [DevFest Lille](https://devfest.gdglille.org/) and [Best of Web Paris](http://bestofweb.paris/). 
I'd like to share with you the slides of the presentation (the video has been recorded and will be available at a later time.)

You might be interested in those two codelabs to get started on this journey:

-   [Build Actions for the Google Assistant - level 2](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/actions-2/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0)
