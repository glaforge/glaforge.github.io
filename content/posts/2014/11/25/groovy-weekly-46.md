My favorite read of the week is definitely Ken Kousen’s tale about Groovy’s [Plain Old Groovy Object](http://www.accelebrate.com/blog/call-pogo-name/)! Note the releases of the new Groovy Eclipse support and the Eclipse Maven batch compiler. Last but not least, for those of you heading to the [Groovy & Grails eXchange conference in London](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1957-groovy-grails-exchange-2014), notice the [program](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/1957-groovy-grails-exchange-2014#program) of the conference unfolding before your eyes!

Let me also mention the [Beaker notebook project](http://beakernotebook.com/index), which offers Groovy support for data scientists who want to explore their data sets. And the [Spoon.net](https://twitter.com/virtualkenji/status/535280638580887553) team which features Groovy support for its Windows containers.

Final word, don’t miss Graeme’s tweets pointing at the Grails 3 scaffolding plugin and code generation APIs!
