The article details the burgeoning popularity of scripting languages on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), particularly highlighted by their significant presence at the JavaOne 2006 conference. By browsing the online session catalog, the author notes that no less than 13 sessions and Birds of a Feather (BOF) discussions are dedicated to scripting.

The author announces their personal milestone of presenting a session at JavaOne for the first time, co-presenting with Tugdual Grall from Oracle. Their session, titled "**Simplify Enterprise Development With Scripting**" (TS-1246), falls under the "Core Platform, JAVA SE" track.

The abstract for this session outlines the core arguments for adopting scripting languages, also known as dynamic languages. It posits that they offer a distinct programming paradigm compared to system languages like Java, enabling developers to rapidly glue components together for application building. The Java platform now supports multiple scripting solutions—specifically mentioning Groovy, JRuby, Jython, and Rhino—which leverage Java's power while providing the simplicity of typeless, interpreted languages. The session aims to demonstrate how scripting can simplify everyday development tasks, such as administering server clusters or quickly prototyping and testing web services. Furthermore, it will explore how the dynamic nature of these languages can enhance agility within Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) and modern AJAX applications, concluding with a discussion on the future of scripting tools.

The article emphasizes the prominent coverage of Groovy and its web framework, Grails, at JavaOne 2006. Grails itself has a dedicated BOF session (BOF-2521) and is featured in another session titled "RAD for the Java Platform Web Tier: Frameworks Smackdown" (TS-1664), both presented by Graeme Rocher, the Grails project lead.

Groovy is explicitly mentioned in a total of six sessions. These include the author's session (TS-1246), Graeme Rocher's Grails BOF (BOF-2521), and Rod Cope's recurring session, "Groovy = Java Technology + Ruby + Python for the JVM" (TS-3273). Other notable Groovy-related sessions include a "Dynamic Scripting Languages" BOF (BOF-0554) and two distinct use-case presentations: "Flash-Gridding with Java Technology: Using Glassfish, Jini/JavaSpaces, and Groovy as an Environment for an Open Source, Self-Assembling Supercomputer" (TS-3714), and "Groovy Goes RFID with Smart Sensors for Real-World Control" (TS-5386).

In assessing the representation of other JVM scripting languages, the author notes a more limited presence. JRuby has only one dedicated session, "JRuby: Bringing Ruby to the JVM Software" (TS-3059). Jython is mentioned in some talks, including those focused on Groovy, with only one session featuring a Jython demonstration. BeanShell receives a mention in a session about TestNG, while Rhino is specifically noted as being mentioned only in the author's own presentation. JavaScript, however, maintains a strong presence for client-side web development, with numerous related presentations.

The article concludes that Groovy has clearly captured the "lion's share" among JVM scripting languages at JavaOne 2006. Overall, the coverage of scripting at the conference has almost doubled compared to the previous year, indicating a significant growth in its importance and adoption. The author expresses considerable satisfaction with Groovy's progress, both in terms of the project's quality and the increasing mindshare it has achieved within the developer community.
