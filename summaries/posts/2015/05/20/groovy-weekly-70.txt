This article provides a comprehensive update on the Groovy ecosystem, primarily highlighting the significant transition of the Groovy project from Codehaus to Apache incubation, alongside various new releases, articles, news, presentations, tweets, and book updates within the community.

**Major Project Migration: Codehaus to Apache Incubation**

The most crucial piece of news is the demise of Codehaus ("gone the way of the dodo"), which necessitates a complete infrastructure migration for the Groovy project as it moves through the Apache incubation process. Users and contributors are strongly advised to update their bookmarks and actively engage with the new Apache-hosted resources. Key changes include:

*   The **JIRA issue tracker has moved** to issues.apache.org.
*   The **Groovy mailing lists are also relocating**, and users need to register for the new lists.
*   The **Apache Git repository is now the official mainline** for the project.
*   An **Apache Groovy GitHub mirror** has been established to facilitate pull requests and contributions.

This transition signifies a new chapter for the Groovy project, requiring the community to adapt to the new organizational and technical infrastructure.

**Featured Highlight: Spock 1.0 Presentation**

Beyond the core migration, the article prominently highlights a "great and thorough" presentation by Marcin Zajączkowski titled "[Smarter Testing Java Code with Spock Framework](https://speakerdeck.com/szpak/smarter-testing-java-code-with-spock-framework)." This slide deck is recommended as an essential resource for anyone looking to learn the latest and greatest features of Spock 1.0, emphasizing its value for mastering smarter Java code testing.
