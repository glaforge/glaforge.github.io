This article snippet highlights significant findings from a recent eWeek report concerning trends in programming language growth, particularly in the job market. The central announcement from eWeek's analysis is that **Groovy has emerged as the fastest-growing programming language.**

According to the data cited by eWeek, which tracks the percentage of job increases or decreases for various programming languages since November 2009, Groovy demonstrated the largest surge in available job opportunities. Following Groovy, C# also showed substantial growth in the job market. A particularly noteworthy and surprising revelation from the eWeek data was the significant increase in job listings for **COBOL**.

The author of the snippet expresses considerable satisfaction with these findings, especially given their publication in eWeek, which they characterize as a "famous online business journal," lending credibility and wide recognition to Groovy's progress. Despite this positive confirmation, the author acknowledges that continued effort is essential. Their ongoing objective for Groovy is to sustain its growth, maintain its momentum, and ultimately solidify its position as the most popular and successful "alternative language" on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform. The article snippet thus serves as both a celebration of Groovy's recent success in the job market and a reminder of the strategic goals for its future development and adoption within the programming community.
