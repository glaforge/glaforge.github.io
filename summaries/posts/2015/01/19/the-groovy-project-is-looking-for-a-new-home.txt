Pivotal, the current sponsor of the popular open-source Groovy programming language and Grails web framework, has announced its decision to cease funding and development support for these projects. This means that Groovy 2.4 and Grails 3.0 will be the last major releases developed under Pivotal's direct sponsorship. As a direct result, both Groovy and Grails are actively seeking new sponsors to ensure their continued full-steam development.

The article emphasizes Groovy's impressive history and current standing in the developer community. The Groovy programming language has been in development for over 11 years, evolving significantly from what started as a side hobby project into a very mature and successful alternative language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its widespread adoption is highlighted by its use in various projects and contexts by Fortune 500 companies globally.

Growth metrics underscore Groovy's popularity and leadership within the JVM language ecosystem. The language saw 1.7 million downloads in 2012, increased to 3 million in 2013, and continued its positive growth with well over 4 million downloads in 2014 (final numbers for 2014 were still being calculated at the time of the article).

Despite this strong performance and community backing, the cessation of Pivotal's sponsorship creates a critical need for new financial backing to maintain the project's momentum and dedicated development effort. The Groovy team expresses a strong desire to continue innovating and improving the language. They have numerous ideas for new features, improvements, and developments aimed at keeping Groovy "ahead of the curve" and enhancing developer productivity on the JVM platform. The article notes that having a handful of team members able to work full-time on the project has been instrumental in its success, and they are actively looking forward to continuing this dedicated work "under a new umbrella."

The article reassures the community that development of Groovy will not stop. The team is committed to pushing Groovy forward, with plans including opening it to new platforms (as they did for Android), implementing new features, fixing bugs, increasing performance, completing new documentation, and launching a new website. The vital role of the Groovy community is also heavily acknowledged; historically, the community has been a "key driver" through providing feedback, bug reports, and contributions both big and small. The team hopes the community will continue to help "find a solution to make Groovy shine as bright as ever" and explicitly welcomes further contributions to sustain the project's pace.

The core conclusion and call to action are directed at potential corporate sponsors. Companies interested in discussing funding for the Groovy project, and potentially employing members of the existing Groovy team, are urged to make direct contact via the dedicated email address: sponsorship@groovy-lang.org. The article concludes with a note of gratitude for potential help and an encouraging message for the community to "keep on groovy’ing!"
