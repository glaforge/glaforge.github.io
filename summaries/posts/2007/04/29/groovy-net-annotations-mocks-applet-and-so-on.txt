This article, written shortly after Groovy secured the JAX 2007 innovation award, serves as a snapshot of the vibrant activity within the Groovy community and previews significant upcoming developments. The author expresses consistent amazement at the "prolific" nature of the "Groovy-sphere," underscoring the dynamic and active engagement of its developers.

The summary begins by highlighting several recent and interesting community contributions and experiments:

1.  **Groovy on .Net:** Chanwit successfully demonstrated Groovy running on the .Net platform by utilizing IKVM, showcasing Groovy's potential for cross-platform deployment beyond the JVM.
2.  **Groovy Mocks for Properties:** Alex provided practical guidance on using Groovy's native mocking capabilities specifically to mock properties, a crucial feature for effective unit testing.
3.  **Groovy Applet (Grapplet):** Andres developed a unique Groovy applet, dubbed a "Grapplet," which allows developers to embed and execute Groovy code directly within `<script>` tags in HTML pages, hinting at new possibilities for client-side scripting and web interactivity.
4.  **COM/ActiveX Integration with Scriptom:** Glen explored the integration of Groovy with desktop applications using Scriptom, Groovy's COM/ActiveX module. He demonstrated this by synchronizing his "Remember the Milk" todo list with Microsoft Outlook, illustrating Groovy's capability to interact with Windows-specific technologies.
5.  **Closure Comparison (Groovy vs. Java):** Danno offered a comparative analysis between Groovy's existing closure notation and the then-upcoming Java closure notation. He argued for Groovy's superiority in terms of conciseness and expressiveness, attributing this advantage to its support for weak typing.
6.  **Higher-Order Messaging (HOM):** Warner delved into advanced programming concepts by experimenting with a Groovy implementation of Higher-Order Messaging, showcasing Groovy's flexibility for exploring complex paradigms.

Beyond these current community efforts, the article shifts focus to major upcoming developments, particularly the release of **Groovy 1.1** and its presence at the **JavaOne** conference. The author announced that the first beta of Groovy 1.1 was slated for release in the immediate "next week," strategically timed just before JavaOne, where both Groovy and Grails (the Groovy-based web framework) would have numerous dedicated sessions.

A key argument presented is the groundbreaking nature of Groovy 1.1. It was set to be the **first alternative language for the JVM to support key Java 5 features, specifically annotations and static imports.** This feature set was presented as a critical differentiator, positioning Groovy as the *sole* alternative language capable of natively leveraging widely-used Java frameworks that rely heavily on annotations. The article explicitly cites examples such as Spring, EJB 3 / JPA, TestNG, and Guice. The strong conclusion drawn is that for developers wishing to utilize a language other than Java while still benefiting from these prevalent, annotation-driven Java frameworks, Groovy 1.1 would be their "best option," solidifying its unique and essential role in the Java ecosystem.
