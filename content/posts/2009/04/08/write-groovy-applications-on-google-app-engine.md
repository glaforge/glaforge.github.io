The news has already spread all around, even on our mailing-lists, but let me echo it again here:

**Groovy is now supported in the newly released Google App Engine Java platform!**

My friend Didier Girard beats me to it and had already [blogged about the support of both Java and Groovy](http://www.insideit.fr/post/2009/04/08/Java-et-Groovy-sont-maintenant-supportes-par-Google-App-Engine) (in French). He was quicker than me... or at least woke up earlier than me ;-)

SpringSource's worked with Google to ensure that Groovy would run well on their platform. Big thanks to the work of Jochen Theodorou, [Matt Taylor](http://weblog.dangertree.net/) and myself, for making this possible!

We [released Groovy 1.6.1](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2009/04/07/Groovy+1.5.8+and+1.6.1+are+out), with key fixes, for that purpose, yesterday, in time for the big news!

If you want to have a go at it, be quick, as they will only allow 10000 developers to access AppEngine Java initially.

I've written a [tutorial for your first steps for Groovy on AppEngine](http://blog.springsource.com/2009/04/07/write-your-google-app-engine-applications-in-groovy/).

I've also written a small [Google Maps / Geocoding service / Flickr demo in 90 lines of Groovy code](http://myowngroovy.appspot.com/demo.groovy).

Enjoy!
