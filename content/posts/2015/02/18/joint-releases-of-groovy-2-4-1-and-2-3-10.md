The Groovy development team is happy to announce the joint releases of the Groovy 2.4.1 and Groovy 2.3.10 of the Groovy programming language for the Java platform.

  

Both releases are bug fix releases, and while Groovy 2.4.1 is the latest official stable branch, we thought it might be helpful to some projects who are still on the 2.3.x line to get a final release for that branch. But going forward, the 2.3.x branch wonâ€™t see any upcoming release.

  

You can learn more about all the tickets closed by reading:
