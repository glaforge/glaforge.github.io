[GR8Conf Europe 2012](http://gr8conf.eu/content/eu2012/index) will take place in Copenhagen, on June 6th-8th. It's the best place to meet all the Groovy folks, from Groovy itself, and from the wealth of the Groovy Ecosystem (Grails, Gradle, GPars, Griffon, Spock, GContracts, CodeNarc, Gaelyk/Caelyf, etc). It's also the best opportunity to stay up-to-date with the latest developments, and discover what's cooking!  

The Call for Paper is open. So don't hesitate to [submit your proposal](http://gr8conf.eu/content/eu2012/cfp).
