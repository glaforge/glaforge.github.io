This week is a bit more positive than the previous with the announcement of the [release of Groovy 2.4](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/groovy-2-4-released)!

But some interesting and thoughtful pieces have also been written about last week’s sad news about Pivotal divesting in Groovy and Grails.

In spite of this, [SpringOne2GX 2015 has been announced with 4 Groovy and Grails tracks](https://twitter.com/springone2gx/status/559903903756861440), in Washington DC, mid-September.

Last but not least, the [second edition of Groovy in Action is going into production](https://twitter.com/mittie/status/558011051313491969)!
