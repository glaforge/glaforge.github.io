This 72th edition is being authored live from the Hackergarten session at [GR8Conf Europe 2015](http://gr8conf.eu/#/), in Copenhagen (Denmark), where Groovy hackers are working on various contributions to the Groovy and Grails ecosystem, updating Grails 2 plugins to Grails 3, crafting a Groovy UI builder for Android, or work on some Gradle plugins. A busy evening!

It’s been a little long while coming, but [Groovy in Action 2nd edition has just been sent to the printers](https://twitter.com/mittie/status/604634440065761280)! And the ebook formats will also be available this week!
