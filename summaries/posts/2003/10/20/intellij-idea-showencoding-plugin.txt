The article details the author's experience and solution regarding the persistent challenge of identifying file encodings within the IntelliJ IDEA development environment.

The author begins by referencing work undertaken "a bit more than a year ago," when they developed a set of utility classes specifically designed for detecting file encodings or charsets. These classes proved effective in ascertaining the encoding of various data forms, including byte arrays, files, and input streams. They were capable of differentiating between common encodings such as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, and Windows-specific Windows-1252. Due to their utility, these classes were successfully integrated into the IntelliJ IDEA platform.

However, despite the integration of these robust encoding detection capabilities into the core of IntelliJ IDEA, a significant practical limitation remained. The author points out that, at the time of writing, IntelliJ IDEA did not provide a user-facing mechanism to display or indicate the charset of the files currently being edited within the IDE. This meant that while the underlying technology to detect encodings existed, the information wasn't readily accessible or visible to the developer working on a file.

Recognizing this gap in functionality, the author took the initiative to file a feature request in June (the specific year is not mentioned, but it logically predates the article's publication) to address this issue. The hope was that the development team behind IntelliJ IDEA would implement a feature to expose the detected file charset to users. Unfortunately, the article states that, by the time of its writing, this requested feature had not yet been implemented.

Faced with the continued absence of this desired functionality and a personal need for it, the author decided to take matters into their own hands. They proceeded to write their own plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, specifically designed to discover and presumably display the charset used in their files. This plugin serves as a practical, self-developed solution to the problem that the official IDE functionality had not yet resolved.

The article concludes by providing relevant links for interested users to access and learn more about this custom-developed plugin. It directs readers to the project page on the IntelliJ IDEA Wiki, where they can find further information and potentially download the plugin: http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShowEncodingPlugin. The article, therefore, functions as both an explanation of a perceived functional deficiency in IntelliJ IDEA and an announcement of a user-created solution to mitigate that issue.
