Next week will be this time of the year where tons of Java developers are gathering & meeting in San Francisco for [JavaOne](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html). It'll be my 10th edition or so, time flies!   
This year, I'll participate to a couple sessions:  

*   **Java and the Commoditization of Machine Intelligence** \[CON2291\]  
    It's a panel discussion with representative from IBM, Microsoft and Google to talk about Machine Learning APIs. I'll be covering the ML APIs from Google Cloud Platform: Vision, Speech, Natural Language.
*   **A Groovy Journey in Open Source** \[CON5932\]  
    In this session, I'll cover the history of the Apache Groovy project, and talk about the latest developments and new features.
