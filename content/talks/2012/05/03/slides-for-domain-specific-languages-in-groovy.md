During the Cloud Foundry Open Tour conference in Moscow, I presented a new presentation of [Domain-Specific Languages in Groovy](http://www.slideshare.net/glaforge/going-to-mars-with-groovy-domainspecific-languages). I've already shared the link here and there (twitter, Google+, mailing-list), but not yet on my blog. So consder this fixed now. This new presentation is inspired from the beta DSL chapter from the second edition of Groovy in Action, where you'll learn how to create a DSL for a little Mars robot. This is a pretty practical approach, bottom-up, as you progressively build the DSL, rather than listing all the existing techniques and illustrate them. I feel the flow is a bit better that way. Anyway... enjoy:
