In the coming months, the Groovy team will be working on a nicer website with a web designer and better and up-to-date documentation. Obviously, this will take quite some time (especially for the content, more than for the look), but in the meantime, I wanted to refresh the look of the [Groovy website](http://groovy.codehaus.org) a bit. So I spent several hours today and tonight playing with CSS3!  

I used Twitter's [Bootstrap grid system](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) which is quite neat. Not only does it provides an easy to use grid system, but it also takes care of typography, menus, and much more. And I used [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) for the Groovy syntax highlighting (the same that I use on this blog).  

And the result looks like this now:
