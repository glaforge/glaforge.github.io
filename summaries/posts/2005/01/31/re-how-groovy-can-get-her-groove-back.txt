This detailed summary addresses the article, which is a response from Guillaume, a core Groovy developer, to criticisms and suggestions primarily from Angsuman, concerning the Groovy project's management, development pace, and release strategy.

The article begins by directly addressing Angsuman's assertion that "Groovy is in dire needs of a project manager." Guillaume refutes this, stating that Groovy already has a project manager, James Strachan. While acknowledging that James had been preoccupied with his "Active*" projects, Guillaume asserts that he is now fully engaged with Groovy. Guillaume details his own interim role during James's absence, where he maintained Groovy, delivered successful betas with numerous bug fixes, organized a JSR meeting with Jeremy in November, and recruited new committers. This team is focused on solidifying the `groovy-core` base in preparation for an upcoming new parser, and JSR discussions are continuously ongoing.

Guillaume then tackles Angsuman's point about software development prioritizing delivery of a "good enough rock solid product on time" over perfection, reserving additional features for future versions. Guillaume argues that Angsuman's perspective conflates Open Source Software (OSS) projects with traditional IT projects, stressing that their constraints are fundamentally different. In IT projects, paying customers expect timely delivery for their investment. In contrast, OSS developers, working in their spare time alongside demanding day jobs, cannot be held to the same commercial deadlines. Guillaume personally highlights that he has invested significant time and money into Groovy without financial return, driven instead by the "pleasure to have a few delighted users."

Regarding the scope of Groovy 1.0, Guillaume clarifies that the primary goal is to "solidify the basic core features" that have been part of the project since its early days. He specifically counters the perception of feature bloat, stating that no significant new language features have been added in over six months. Instead, the current effort is directed at standardizing and correctly implementing the coherent semantics of existing language constructs, such as `continue`, `break`, and `return` within closures, which were previously not fully established. The project's scope, he emphasizes, has remained consistent for several months, with the only "room for extensibility" being architectural hooks for future features like supporting Java 5 annotations (via the new parser's Java 5 grammar) or adding new operators (like `.@`) to reduce ambiguity in scoping rules.

Responding to Angsuman's comment about expectations for stable betas and appropriate numbering schemes (alpha vs. beta), Guillaume concedes that the Groovy project made mistakes in its numbering. He agrees that a more appropriate sequence would have been 0.1, 0.2, 0.x, leading to 1.0-beta-x, then 1.0-RC-x, before a final 1.0 release. To rectify this, the team plans to issue a new beta (beta-10) within two weeks, with subsequent milestones tagged `jsr-x` that will incorporate the new parser. Guillaume sets a tentative target of releasing Groovy 1.0 before the end of Q2, but firmly states that he cannot provide a "firm and definitive target date." He attributes this impossibility to the nature of an OSS project, where unforeseen personal circumstances of developers (new jobs, family events) can directly impact progress, unlike the controlled environment of IT projects.

Guillaume elaborates on the differences between IT and OSS projects using the classic "four variables" of IT project management: scope, cost, time, and quality.
1.  **Scope:** Has remained unchanged for months, focusing on core features to differentiate Groovy from alternatives like BeanShell or Jython.
2.  **Cost:** Limited to the developers' spare time and a finite number of contributors. This variable cannot be easily "tweaked" as it depends heavily on personal commitments and day jobs, although new committers have been recruited to help solidify the base.
3.  **Quality:** Must not be compromised under any circumstances.
4.  **Time:** This is identified as the *only* variable the Groovy team can adjust to ensure the desired quality level.

Addressing the point that "even Open Source projects are not immune to this paradigm," especially those with significant interest, Guillaume acknowledges the "incredible amount" of interest and the resulting pressure on the developers. He expresses hope not to disappoint users and even challenges readers to name other OSS projects that have experienced such intense pressure on their developers. He concludes that expectations for Groovy are "very high."

Finally, Guillaume responds to Angsuman's suggestion for Groovy leads to "fix a reasonable date of release 1 and stick to it making compromises along the way," and the observation that Groovy "needs help." Guillaume reaffirms the commitment to deliver Groovy with the "original scope James envisioned," focusing strictly on core functionalities. He mentions that the new parser has already been wired into CVS Head with "amazingly quick" progress and expects it to ship either in the upcoming beta-10 (if delayed slightly) or by the end of February, pending a decision on the best date for its initial "warm-up." He also mentions the creation of a more accurate "Roadmap" on the Groovy website to provide better visibility to the community.

Concluding, Guillaume acknowledges Guillaume's (likely a typo, probably referring to himself as "Guillaume commented") statement about the pressure on developers being the "price for fame." He dismisses the idea of personal fame, stating his involvement in Groovy was purely pragmatic: he needed a JVM scripting language for dynamic logic, runtime modifiable business rules, and to avoid frequent software redeployments. He envisions Groovy as a tool for injecting agility into projects, saving time in shell scripting, and seamlessly integrating platform-specific capabilities (like Scriptom) with the vast Java ecosystem. He concludes by stating that "Groovy is the right tool for agility business."
