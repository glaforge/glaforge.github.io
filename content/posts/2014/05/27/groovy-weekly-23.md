The big news of this edition is the release of Grails 2.4, with standalone GORM and GSP, with more static compilation that even understands dynamic aspects of Grails, with a new asset pipeline, with GORM sub-queries, and with a new Maven plugin.

The other big news is that next week is the GR8Conf Europe week! So you’ll certainly see lots of nice and interesting presentations being put online next week. And I hope I’ll also be able to publish this weekly news brief in time too!
