This feature is presented as a paradigm shift for API design in Groovy, favoring behavior composition to enhance code readability and maintainability.
*   **Closures:** **"Applying Groovy Closures for Fun and Productivity [CON1769]"** further explores the extensive benefits of Groovy's closures. Beyond their use in higher-order functions, the session promises to unlock a "treasure" of capabilities, demonstrating how closures can be applied to implement various design patterns, create fluent interfaces, and even program asynchrony, boosting developer productivity.

**Practical Applications and Problem Solving**

The conference agenda also features sessions focused on practical challenges and solutions in Groovy development:

*   **Puzzlers:** **"Groovy and Grails Puzzlers: As Usual—Traps, Pitfalls, and End Cases [CON1764]"** offers a fun yet insightful session, reminiscent of Java puzzlers, that explores common traps, pitfalls, and edge cases encountered in hard-core Groovy/Grails development. It features contributions from recognized "Groovy senseis," providing enlightenment and humor derived from real-world mistakes and failures.
*   **Polyglot Web Development:** **"HTML5/AngularJS/Groovy/Java and MongoDB Together: What Could Possibly Go Wrong? [CON1703]"** addresses the common practice of rapid prototyping with dynamic languages. It demonstrates how to quickly build a minimum viable product (MVP) using a modern polyglot stack including HTML5, AngularJS, Bootstrap, web services, Java, MongoDB, and Groovy. The session showcases the synergy of these tools in creating a functional, mobile/browser-friendly application with tests, emphasizing Groovy's role in rapid development within a robust JVM environment.
*   **Pluggability and DSLs:** **"Plugging Users In: Extend Your Application with Pluggable Groovy DSL [CON1752]"** shares JFrog's experience in enabling user extensibility through Groovy-authored plug-in interfaces. It explains the concept of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), their relevance to user plug-ins, and how they can be implemented in Groovy or Java. Critical aspects like good public API design, security concerns, and classpath isolation issues are also discussed.
*   **Highly Concurrent Applications:** **"Writing Highly Concurrent Polyglot Applications with Vert.x [CON7902]"** introduces Vert.x as a lightweight, high-performance, polyglot, and asynchronous application platform for the JVM. The session explores Vert.x's design principles, concurrency model, and key features like the distributed event bus and high availability. Demonstrations include examples across several JVM languages, including Java, JavaScript, Scala, and Groovy, highlighting Groovy's suitability for such platforms.
*   **Spring Framework Integration:** **"Spring 4TW! [CON3693]"** details the new features of Spring 4, designed to support modern web developers and enrich enterprise applications. Crucially, it highlights Spring 4's explicit support for the Groovy language, alongside other advancements like WebSocket support, conditional configuration, Java 8 and Java EE 7 integration, and the introduction of Spring Boot as a productive entry point.
