I'm glad I just received my [Maven Developer's Notebook](http://mavenbook.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Book), from O'Reilly. My friend [Vincent Massol](http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/vmassol/) and Tim O'Brien co-authored this great book on [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), a definitely needed reading for all those who want to learn more about Maven, or who wants to get started quickly. I had the chance of being one of the reviewers and it allowed me to learn quite a few tricks in the process, at the same time I was converting one of my projects at work to a "mavenized" build process and integrating it inside [Luntbuild](http://www.pmease.com/luntbuild/) for continuous integration. I particularly liked the "best practices" aspects both authors managed to give throughout the different labs. This book is a must read, go and get it at your nearest bookstore!
