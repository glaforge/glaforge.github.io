![](http://www.groovymag.com/images/gm1_200.jpg)I'm very happy to echo the release of the first issue of [GroovyMag](http://www.groovymag.com/main/), the Groovy and Grails magazine! This is an electronic PDF magazine which will bring you news, articles and tutorials around the [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) dynamic language for the JVM and the [Grails](http://grails.org/) agile web application framework.

As the [site](http://www.groovymag.com/main/) shows:

> GroovyMag covers a wide variety of topics in the Groovy and Grails world, featuring some of the best and brightest names in the Groovosphere. Our first issue includes a Grails tutorial, a Groovy/Swing tutorial, community news and more.

In this first issue, you'll find:

*   A preface by Michael Kimsal, the creator of GroovyMag
*   Groovy and Grails community news, and a featured Grails plugin, by Dave Klein
*   A Grails introduction article, by Robert Fischer
*   Builder Swing rich applications with Groovy, by Andres Almiray
*   An opinion piece on Groovy being the future of Java, by Shawn Hartsock
*   An interview of Marcus Irven of Minggl, a company bulding products in Grails

GroovyMag looks very promising, and I wish the best of luck to Michael and its editors, authors and columnists. I also look forward to finding some time to contribute to the magazine myself! [Go check it out](http://www.groovymag.com/main/), it's worth every cent!
