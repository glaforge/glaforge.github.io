The article introduces `gcli-mdrun`, a "smart little script" that enables users to transform standard Markdown files into executable scripts powered by the Gemini Command Line Interface (CLI). Inspired by a HackerNews post about "executable Markdown," this project aims to facilitate the creation of AI-driven automation, pipelines, and autonomous bots using simple Markdown text files. The project is hosted on GitHub.

**Core Concept and Quick Start:**
At its heart, `gcli-mdrun` allows Markdown files to act as scripts by interpreting their content (specifically the text below a shebang line) as prompts for Gemini CLI. For instance, a file named `weather.md` can start with `#!/usr/bin/env gemini-run` followed by an instruction like "Use only the Google Search tool to find the answer to the question below: What is the weather like in Paris right now?". When this file is made executable and run (`chmod +x weather.md; ./weather.md`), `gcli-mdrun` invokes Gemini CLI to process the prompt, leading to an AI-generated response, such as current weather conditions.

**Installation:**
To use `gcli-mdrun`, users need to download the `gemini-run` wrapper script from the `scripts/` directory of its GitHub repository. This script then needs to be made executable and moved to a system path (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/`). Prerequisites include having Gemini CLI already installed and a valid Gemini API key configured as a `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

**Usage & Features:**

1.  **YOLO Mode (Autonomous Execution):** By including the `--yolo` flag in the shebang line (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env -S gemini-run --yolo`), users can enable autonomous execution. In this mode, Gemini CLI will execute tools and commands suggested by the AI without requiring explicit user confirmation. The article warns users to "Use with caution!" due to the inherent risks of unsupervised execution. An example demonstrates listing and renaming files in a directory automatically.
2.  **Piping and Pipelines:** `gemini-run` supports standard Unix input/output operations, meaning scripts can receive input via `stdin` and redirect output via `stdout`. This allows for chaining multiple Markdown scripts together (e.g., `cat customers.log | ./step1_extract.md | ./step2_analyze.md`) or combining them with other Unix tools. Outputs can also be redirected to files. The article notes that for complex input/argument handling, Gemini CLI's custom commands might be more suitable than simple piping.

**Real-World Examples:** The article provides several practical examples showcasing the versatility of `gcli-mdrun`:

1.  **Automated Release Notes (`git-log-summary.md`):** This script analyzes recent git commits in the current directory and generates structured release notes. It utilizes Gemini CLI's `run_shell_command` tool to execute `git` commands, fetching logs and diffs. Crucially, the shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env -S gemini-run --model gemini-2.5-flash --allowed-tools=run_shell_command(git)`) explicitly restricts Gemini CLI to only use the `git` command via `run_shell_command`, highlighting a key security feature for allowing or forbidding specific tools.
2.  **Intelligent Search (`google-search.md`):** This example demonstrates fetching real-time information from the web. A Markdown script is used to query the weather in Paris, with the shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env -S gemini-run --allowed-tools=google_web_search,web_fetch`) restricting the AI to use only Google Web Search and Web Fetch tools for safety and precision.
3.  **Visual Summaries with Nano Banana (`nano-banana.md`):** This creative example leverages the `nanobanana` MCP server or Gemini CLI extension to generate infographics and mindmaps. A script is shown that takes an article URL, asks Gemini CLI (via the `nanobanana` server) to find key points, and then generate a sketchnote mindmap with specific styling instructions. The output is a visually appealing infographic summarizing the article.
4.  **Chaining Search and Graphics (`nano-banana-chain.md`):** This example combines the previous concepts by piping the output of the "Intelligent Search" script (weather in Paris) into a Nano Banana script. This allows for dynamically generated information (like weather data) to be immediately transformed into a custom-styled infographic, showcasing powerful multi-step automation.

**Conclusion:**
The article concludes by emphasizing that `gcli-mdrun` aims to make AI more accessible and seamlessly integrable into existing workflows. By treating Markdown as a form of executable code, the project effectively bridges the gap between human-readable documentation and machine-executable tasks, leveraging the power of Gemini CLI with a lightweight shell script. Users are encouraged to explore the project on GitHub and create their own executable Markdown scripts.
