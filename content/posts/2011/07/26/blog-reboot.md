It was time I rebooted my old blog! It used to be in PHP, and it's time to move to the next millenium with a blog engine written in [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org), using the [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com) lightweight toolkit, and deployed on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).
