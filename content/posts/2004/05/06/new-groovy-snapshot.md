Since Groovy's move from one server to another, we could not deliver the latest jars. We're sorry for that, but we're doing our best to fix all the little issues you've encountered (broken links, missing jar, etc) It's not without difficulty that I managed to upload the latest snapshot of groovy, but I'm glad to announce that there is a new groovy-1.0-rc1-snapshot.jar.

You can find it here:

[http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/dist/groovy/jars/](http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/dist/groovy/jars/)

If you're still using beta-4, please upgrade to the latest snapshot. Though there are still some bugs we haven't fixed yet regarding "verify errors" and such, this snapshot is already much more stable. Next week, we should release a new distribution.

Enjoy.
