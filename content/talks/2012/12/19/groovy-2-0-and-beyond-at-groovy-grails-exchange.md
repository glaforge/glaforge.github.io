Last week, I had the pleasure to attend and keynote at the 5th edition of the [Groovy / Grails eXchange conference](http://skillsmatter.com/event/groovy-grails/groovy-grails-exchange-2012), in London. I presented a talk around the [new features of Groovy 2.0 and the upcoming 2.1 release](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/groovy-grails/keynote-speech), as well as a few words about what's coming up next.  

You can watch the video online, as [SkillsMatter](http://skillsmatter.com/), the organizer of the conference, have put all the presentations online in record time!
