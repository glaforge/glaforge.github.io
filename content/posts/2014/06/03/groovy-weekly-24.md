Direct live from [GR8Conf Europe](http://gr8conf.eu/)!

Several speakers already uploaded their presentation slides, as you shall see in the “presentations” sections. And the videos will be available later after the conference.

At the same time in San Francisco, Apple is running its WWDC conference and announced the creation of a new language, [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), that [looks a lot like Groovy](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/apple-s-swift-programming-language-inspired-by-groovy) as several Groovy users have already noticed on Twitter. That’s nice to see Groovy also influences other languages!
