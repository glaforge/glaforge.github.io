[GR8Conf Europe 2013](http://gr8conf.eu/index) was such a blast! With close to well over 160 attendees, the conference was a real success, and went flawlessly thanks to the great organization of SÃ¸ren and his crew. Big congrats to his team! And for the 5th anniversary of the conference, the [Groovy cakes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/steveonjava/8803004028/) were so delicious! It was a pleasure to be back in Copenhagen to meet all my friends from the Groovy community.  

I had a chance to speak about Groovy 2 and beyond, and I'm embedding the slides below, if you want to have a look at them. Also, if all goes well, we should even get a video recording of the presentation(s) this year, so fingers crossed!
