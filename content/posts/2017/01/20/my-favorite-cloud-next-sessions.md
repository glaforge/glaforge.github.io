The [schedule](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule) for Google [Cloud Next](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/) was unveiled this week, and there's lots of interesting sessions to attend. With the many parallel tracks, it's difficult to make a choice, but I wanted to highlight some of the talks I'd like to watch!

The Google Cloud Platform is a pretty rich one, with many options for your compute needs. How do you choose which one is best for your use case? Brian Dorsey covers this in detail in this session:

["Where should I run my code?" Deciding between Compute Engine, Container Engine, App Engine and more](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=where-should-i-run-my-code-deciding-between-compute-engine-container-engine-app-engine-and-more-91e716a3-813e-43c9-a513-27d3365a449b)

To explore a bit further some of the compute options, I'd recommend looking at Container Engine with [ABCs of Google Container Engine: tips and best practices](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=abcs-of-google-container-engine-tips-and-best-practices-03ed20df-b6c9-4e0a-911f-b33017f53477) by Piotr Szczesniak, and [Go beyond PaaS with App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=go-beyond-paas-with-app-engine-flexible-environment-89abaf38-fce4-451c-b0e3-7726013300df) by Justin Beckwith.

The Serverless trend is strong these days, and in this area, I spotted two slots here with Firebase, Cloud Functions: [Live coding a serverless app with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=live-coding-a-serverless-app-with-firebase-and-google-cloud-platform-d9026f62-4bfe-4087-b2d8-ffacd52222a2) by Mike McDonald, Jen Tong, Frank van Puffelen, and [Serverless computing options with Google Cloud Platform](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=serverless-computing-options-with-google-cloud-platform-1beab0c1-740e-4ee5-82f7-2fc020cdb295) by Bret McGowen.

I've blogged before about Cloud Endpoints, as I'm interested in the world of [Web APIs]({{< ref "/tags/web-apis" >}}), and there are two talks I'd like to attend in this area: [Google Cloud Endpoints: serving your API to the world](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=google-cloud-endpoints-serving-your-api-to-the-world-8eaeb271-f0ea-4638-af94-16c0b2b80bf6) by Francesc Campoy Flores and [Authorizing service-to-service calls with Google Cloud Endpoints](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=authorizing-service-to-service-calls-with-google-cloud-endpoints-24f2852c-e586-4fe9-8eb6-0e13e8585800) by Dan Ciruli, Sep Ebrahimzadeh.

And in my misc. category, I'd like to highlight this one on the APIs for G Suite: [Developing new apps built for your organization with Google Docs, Slides, Sheets and Sites APIs](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=developing-new-apps-built-for-your-organization-with-google-docs-slides-sheets-and-sites-apis-bc17ab71-ce12-4057-bcc6-7fe536f67490) by Ritcha Ranjan. A talk on big parallel data processing with [Using Apache Beam for parallel data processing](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=using-apache-beam-for-parallel-data-processing-a7a06ee0-7b93-4559-82e0-1a8dfd515771) by Frances Perry.

And to finish, I have to mention my own talk, that I'll be presenting with Brad Abrams: [Talking to your users: Build conversational actions for Google Assistant](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/schedule#target=talking-to-your-users-build-conversational-actions-for-google-assistant-5a780cf1-4cc2-4ce4-824d-4ff7b7c7a14c). It should be fun!

What talks are you going to attend?
