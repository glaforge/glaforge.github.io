In the [first part of this series]({{<ref "/posts/2025/07/23/mastering-agentic-workflows-with-ADK-sub-agents.md" >}}), we explored the _"divide and conquer"_ strategy using **sub-agents** to create a flexible, modular team of AI specialists. This is perfect for situations where the user is in the driver's seat, directing the flow of conversation. But what about when the _process_ itself needs to be in charge?

Some tasks are inherently linear. You have to do Step A before Step B, and Step B before Step C. Think about a CI/CD pipeline: you build, then you test, then you deploy. You can't do it out of order... or if you do, be prepared for havoc!

For these situations, the [ADK for Java](https://github.com/google/adk-java) provides another powerful tool in our orchestration toolbox: the **`SequentialAgent`**.

## When order matters: the sequential workflow

A sequential workflow is all about creating a predictable, step-by-step process. Unlike the flexible sub-agent model where an orchestrator LLM decides which sub-agent to invoke and when, a `SequentialAgent` executes a predefined list of agents in a fixed order.

This is useful for:

- **Automating multi-step processes:** Guiding a user through a fixed procedure, like a trip planner or a complex data analysis pipeline.
- **Ensuring consistency:** Guaranteeing that tasks are always performed in the correct sequence for reliable and predictable outcomes.
- **Building on previous results:** Creating workflows where the output of one step is the essential input for the next.

## A practical example: a `trip-planner`

Let's dive into our `SequentialFlow.java` example (code further down). This code defines a `trip-planner` agent that guides a user through the process of planning a vacation. You can't suggest restaurants before you have an itinerary, and you can't build an itinerary before you've researched the destination. This is a perfect use case for a `SequentialAgent`.

Our `trip-planner` consists of three specialist agents that will be executed in a specific order:

1.  **`destination-researcher`**: The first step. It takes a user's request (e.g., _"a romantic weekend in Paris"_) and finds suitable attractions.
2.  **`itinerary-creator`**: The second step. It takes the list of attractions from the previous step and organizes it into a logical 2-day plan.
3.  **`restaurant-suggester`**: The final step. It takes the completed itinerary and enriches it with relevant lunch and dinner recommendations.

I'll show you the full source code here first, but then in subsequent sections, we'll explore each steps in more detail.

```java

        destinationResearcher,
        itineraryCreator,

    )

{{</ details >}}

## The magic ‚ú® of state passing: `outputKey`

_"But wait,"_ you ask, _"if these are separate agents, how does the `itinerary-creator` know what the `destination-researcher` found?"_

This is the core mechanism of the `SequentialAgent`: **passing state between agents**. The ADK makes this incredibly simple and elegant using an `outputKey`.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1.  **The _producer_ agent:** The agent that generates the data uses the `.outputKey("some-key")` method. This tells the `SequentialAgent` to store the final result of this agent's turn in a context variable named `some-key`.

    ```java
    var destinationResearcher = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("destination-researcher")
        // ... instructions ...
        .outputKey("destination-research") // <-- Produces the data
        .build();
    ```

2.  **The _consumer_ agent:** The next agent in the sequence can then reference this stored data directly in its instructions using curly braces: `{some-key}`.

    ```java
    var itineraryCreator = LlmAgent.builder()
        .name("itinerary-creator")
        .instruction("""
            Your role is to create a logical itinerary
            from the provided list of attractions:

            {destination-research} // <-- Consumes the data

            Group the attractions by proximity or theme for each day.
            """)
        .outputKey("itinerary") // Can produce data for the next agent!
        .build();
    ```

The ADK handles the injection automatically. The `{destination-research}` placeholder will be replaced by the full output of the `destinationResearcher` agent before the prompt is sent to the `itineraryCreator` agent.

## Building the `SequentialAgent`

Putting it all together is straightforward. We use the `SequentialAgent.builder()` and provide our agents to the `.subAgents()` method.
The key difference here is that **the order is strictly enforced**.

```java
return SequentialAgent.builder()
    .name("trip-planner")
    .description("""
        Helps you plan a trip by finding attractions,
        creating an itinerary, and suggesting restaurants.
        """)
    .subAgents(
        destinationResearcher, // will always run first
        itineraryCreator,      // will always run second
        restaurantSuggester    // will always run third
    )
    .build();
```

When this agent runs, it will execute `destinationResearcher`, take its output, feed it into `itineraryCreator`, take _its_ output, feed it into `restaurantSuggester`, and finally return the completed, enriched itinerary to the user.
The last agent could also reference the output of the first agent if needed, for full context awareness!

## Example run

{{< details summary="Click to see the the output of a full run" >}}

Ideally, you would have a first agent collecting key information like the destination, number of days of the stay, the budget you plan to spend, the types of attractions you'd like to visit, and the sort of cuisine you want to eat.
Here, I'm going straight with the full detailed request:

```
üë§ You > Plan a trip of 5 days in Paris, with a medium budget,
to visit the key tourist attractions (museums, parks, landmarks),
and eat French cuisine!
```

Let's see what the destination research replies:

There's a restaurant being suggested twice, as it's in the same area, another one that's not really French cuisine,
or sometimes it's some small food-on-the-go suggestsions to keep the budget on target.
In some places, the LLM would have liked more precise guidance to help you make a choice.
But overall, the culinary expert gave some good suggestions!

## When to choose `SequentialAgent`

- Choose a **`SequentialAgent`** when you have a fixed, linear process where Step B logically depends on the output of Step A. It provides predictability and structure.
- Choose an **`LlmAgent` with sub-agents** (as in [part 1]({{<ref "/posts/2025/07/23/mastering-agentic-workflows-with-ADK-sub-agents.md" >}})) when you need flexibility and want the orchestrator LLM to dynamically decide the best tool or next step based on the conversational context.

By understanding both patterns, you can build incredibly robust and sophisticated AI systems tailored to the specific problem you're trying to solve.

Stay tuned for the next part of the series, where we'll explore how to run agents in parallel to handle multiple tasks at once!
