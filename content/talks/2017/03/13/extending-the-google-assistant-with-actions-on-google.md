Last week, in San Francisco, took place the [Google Cloud Next 2017](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/) conference, and I had the pleasure to co-present a session on "Extending the Google Assistant with Actions on Google", with Brad Abrams, product manager on the assistant technology at Google.

> The Google Assistant is the conversational user interface that helps you get things done in your world. Actions on Google let you build on this assistance, while your integrations can help you engage users through Google Home on Pixel, Android and many other devices that connect with Google Assistant. In this session, we'll share the latest innovations behind the Google Assistant and how you can leverage those technologies and best practices for Voice User Interface design to build your own custom extensions to Google Assistant.

In this presentation, for our demonstration, we used [API.AI](https://api.ai/) and [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/) (announced as beta during the keynote) to implement our assistant, whose job was to help attendees learn more about the conference schedule and see which talks they'd be interested in attending.
