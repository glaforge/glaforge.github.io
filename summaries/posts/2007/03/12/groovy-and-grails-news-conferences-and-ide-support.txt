This article provides a detailed update on the vibrant and rapidly evolving Groovy and Grails community, highlighting key developments in community resources, major conferences, and crucial IDE tooling support, emphatically declaring 2007 as a pivotal year for both technologies.

The author begins by addressing the challenge of staying current with Groovy and Grails news due to high-traffic mailing lists. To circumvent this, two primary resources are recommended:
1.  **AboutGroovy**: A community news portal offering frequent updates, podcast interviews, and pointers to significant resources covering all aspects of Groovy and Grails.
2.  **GroovyBlogs**: Described as a JavaBlog-like news aggregator, it compiles feeds from the Groovy and Grails mailing lists and numerous prominent bloggers who are actively promoting Groovy and Grails.
Notably, both of these essential community tools were developed using Grails, with GroovyBlogs specifically created by Glen Smith in under 24 hours, showcasing Grails' rapid development capabilities.

The summary then shifts its focus to the increasing presence of Groovy and Grails at significant industry conferences:
*   **JavaOne**: A preliminary search revealed no less than 8 sessions mentioning Groovy, a notable increase of two sessions compared to the previous year. The author highlighted two sessions he was personally involved in: "TS-1742: Cool things you can do with the Groovy programming language" with Guillaume Alléon and Dierk Koenig, and "BOF-6133: Grails: Spring + Hibernate development re-invented" with Graeme Rocher. This indicates growing mainstream recognition for the technologies.
*   **QCon (London)**: The author was scheduled to present two sessions during the week of the article's publication. These included "Implementing Domain-Specific Languages in Groovy" with John Wilson, emphasizing Groovy's suitability for DSL creation due to its flexible syntax and expressivity. He also presented "Grails: Spring + Hibernate development re-invented," stepping in for Graeme Rocher, to explain how Grails simplifies web application development.
*   **Sun TechDays in Paris**: Scheduled for March 20th/21st, the author was slated to speak about Groovy as an "alternative language for the JVM." A significant highlight was the repeated presence of James Gosling, the creator of Java. The author recounted a personal experience where Gosling shared his positive experience using Groovy on internal Sun projects and praised the language, an endorsement also reflected in Gosling's foreword for the "Groovy in Action" book. The article also encourages readers to consult Slashdot's review of the book.
*   **Grails eXchange (London)**: Scheduled for the end of May, this was presented as the much-anticipated first dedicated conference for Groovy and Grails. The article notes that more such events are expected in both the US and Europe. It boasts an "incredible line of renown speakers" including Rod Johnson, Joe Walker, Rob Harrop, Rod Cope, Dierk Koenig, and Joe Walnes, positioning it as the premier opportunity to connect with key figures and learn advanced techniques.

Finally, the article addresses a common past concern: the lack of comprehensive tooling support for Groovy IDEs. It confirms that improving IDE support is a high priority for 2007, with significant advancements underway:
*   **Eclipse Plugin**: The Eclipse plugin for Groovy is making "great progress," with code-completion functionality "not very far" from release. Screenshots of the ongoing development were available on Ed's blog.
*   **NetBeans IDE for Grails**: Engineers at Sun were actively investigating the development of a dedicated Grails IDE for NetBeans. This potential development could build upon the existing Coyote Groovy plugin and would offer specialized wizards for Grails artifacts, alongside full Groovy language support.
*   **IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains, the developer of the author's "favorite Java IDE," was exploring how to revive and enhance the GroovyJ plugin, aiming to achieve the same high level of integration and functionality seen in their JavaScript or Ruby support.

The article concludes by reiterating the immense activity within the Groovy and Grails community, acknowledging the difficulty in keeping up with everything. It confidently declares that "2007 is really the year of Groovy and Grails," signaling a period of significant growth, adoption, and maturation for both technologies.
