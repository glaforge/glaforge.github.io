Sometimes, there are some unlogical choices that are being made: [JBoss chooses](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=36452) [JSPWiki](http://www.jspwiki.org/) as a base for their Wiki portlet in JBoss Portal. They choose to fork and trim JSPWiki (rather than contributing to it) to be able to embed a Wiki engine in their portal as a portlet. Fine. But why not choosing [XWiki](http://www.xwiki.org/)? XWiki:

*   is a member of the [JBoss Open Source Federation](http://www.jboss.org/federation/MemberXWiki),
*   can already be [integrated in JBoss Portal](http://www.jboss.org/federation/MemberXWiki),
*   and moreover can also be integrated in any portlet container (The proof is that the [eXo Platform](http://www.exoplatform.com/) already embeds XWiki as a portlet).

That's weird, isn't it?
