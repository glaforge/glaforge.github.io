The Groovy team has officially announced its intention to join the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), marking a significant strategic move for the future of the Groovy programming language project. This decision comes in the wake of a recent announcement from Pivotal, a key sponsor, to discontinue funding for full-time developers dedicated to the Groovy project.

The primary motivation behind seeking a new organizational home is to unequivocally demonstrate to the Groovy community that the project is committed to its long-term viability and sustainability. This commitment is intended to be independent of specific sponsoring organizations' funding decisions and resilient to any future changes in the team of committers. By finding a stable and established foundation, the Groovy team aims to secure the project's future as a robust open-source endeavor.

Prior to this announcement, the Groovy team engaged in extensive discussions, both online and offline, with representatives from various prominent software foundations. These included the Eclipse Foundation, the Software Conservancy foundation, and the Apache Software Foundation itself. The team expressed profound gratitude for the time, advice, and insights provided by all parties involved, including users, committers from other projects, and board members of the respective foundations. These discussions were described as highly fruitful and enlightening, providing valuable perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of each potential host.

While acknowledging that all the considered foundations were interesting and could potentially be a good fit for the Groovy project, each with its own set of pros and cons, the Apache Software Foundation ultimately emerged as the preferred candidate. The Groovy team concluded that the ASF best aligns with their project's specific constraints and philosophical outlook.

Looking ahead, the Groovy team will soon commence the formal process of submitting a proposal for incubation within the Apache Software Foundation. Should this proposal be accepted, the team anticipates working closely with mentors during the incubation period. This phase will be crucial for addressing various "grey areas" that were identified during earlier mailing list discussions. The overarching goal during incubation is to ensure that Groovy not only successfully integrates into the Apache ecosystem but also continues to thrive and remain a major open-source project within the JVM ecosystem. This move is presented as a confident step towards solidifying Groovy's enduring presence and development in the open-source world.
