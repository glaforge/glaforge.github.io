Groovy keeps rocking with a [joint release of Groovy 2.4.1 and also a 2.3.10](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/joint-releases-of-groovy-2-4-1-and-2-3-10)!

  

And did you notice the nice new design of the [new Grails website](https://grails.org/), based on [Groovy’s website](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)? That’s a family look!

  

Also, I’d like to end this short editorial with a big congrats to the [GVM team who’s reached the 100,000 unique installs](https://twitter.com/gvmtool/status/570138706973224960)! That’s a big milestone!
