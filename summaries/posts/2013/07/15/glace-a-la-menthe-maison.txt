This article provides a detailed, step-by-step recipe for making refreshing homemade mint ice cream without the need for an ice cream maker. The author, inspired by summer heat and an abundance of garden mint, sought to create a cooling dessert.

**Key Ingredients:**
The recipe requires a modest list of ingredients:
*   25 cl of milk
*   A generous handful of fresh mint leaves
*   2 eggs (separated into yolks and whites)
*   60g of powdered sugar (ideally icing sugar), divided into 10g and 50g portions
*   25 cl of full-fat liquid cream
*   1 pinch of salt

**Preparation Process:**

1.  **Mint Infusion:** The process begins by infusing the fresh mint leaves in the milk. This is done in a covered saucepan for about twenty minutes, ensuring the milk does not boil, which allows the mint's flavour to permeate the milk thoroughly.

2.  **Whipped Cream (Chantilly):** Concurrently, Chantilly cream is prepared. The 25 cl of full-fat liquid cream is whipped with 50g of sugar. A critical tip for success is to chill the mixing bowl or utensil beforehand, as the fat content in the cream is essential for it to set properly and prevent it from failing.

3.  **Egg Yolk Mixture:** In a separate bowl, the two egg yolks are combined with the remaining 10g of sugar and beaten until the mixture lightens slightly in color.

4.  **Combining Initial Components:** Once the mint-infused milk has cooled down, it is strained to remove the mint leaves and then mixed with the sugared egg yolks. This combined mixture is then gently folded into the prepared Chantilly cream.

5.  **Egg Whites (Meringue):** To add volume and lightness to the ice cream, the two egg whites are beaten with a pinch of salt until they form firm, stiff peaks (known as "blancs en neige").

6.  **Delicate Folding:** The stiffly beaten egg whites are then very carefully incorporated into the main mixture (comprising the mint milk, egg yolks, and whipped cream). This is done using a circular motion, scooping from the bottom upwards, to maintain the air and volume introduced by the egg whites.

7.  **First Freezing Stage:** The entire preparation is then poured into a freezer-safe container and placed in the freezer for several hours until it solidifies.

8.  **Crucial Blending Step for Creaminess:** After the initial freezing period, the article highlights a crucial step for achieving an extra creamy, smooth texture without an ice cream maker: the partially frozen mixture is removed from the freezer and blended in a mixer. This process breaks down any ice crystals that may have formed, resulting in a much smoother, more unctuous consistency.

9.  **Optional Additions and Final Freezing:** Before returning the ice cream to the freezer for its final set, optional ingredients can be added. These include dark chocolate shavings or very finely chopped fresh mint leaves (with a caution against large pieces, which could be unpleasant to eat). The ice cream is then returned to the freezer for a second time until fully set.

**Yield and Important Considerations:**

*   **Serving Size:** The recipe yields approximately 6-8 scoops of ice cream, suitable for about 3 people, and the proportions can be easily doubled for more servings.
*   **Natural Color:** An important conclusion drawn by the author is that natural homemade mint ice cream will *not* be green. The color typically associated with mint ice cream or syrups is due to artificial food colorings. The homemade version, due to the egg yolks, will naturally be a beige color. For those who desire the conventional green hue, the author suggests adding about 3 drops of blue food coloring to achieve a "beautiful green."

The article concludes by inviting the reader to enjoy this refreshing, homemade mint ice cream.
