Last week, I was in Tokyo for the first time, to speak at the Google Cloud Next conference. During the DevDay, I spoke about Google App Engine and its 2nd generation runtimes, and I also presented Cloud Run on how to deploy and run containers in a serverless fashion. It's been awesome to visit Japan for the first time and get a chance to meet developers there. Here are the slides I presented:
