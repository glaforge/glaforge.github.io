For example, when I present a talk at a conference, often the video becomes available at a later time, and I&amp;rsquo;m not the owner of the channel or video. At first, I wanted to use the YouTube Data API, but I had the impression that I could only see the stats of videos or channels I own, however I think I might be wrong, and should probably revisit this approach later on.</description></item></channel></rss>
