Just before heading to [Google Cloud Next](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next18/sf/), I was notified I was listed 4th in JAX London's Top 20 Java influencers of 2018 on social media! It's an honor to be listed among famous figures like Josh Bloch, Brian Goetze, Martin Thompson, Arun Gupta, Jessica Kerr, Mario Fusco, Josh Long, Venkat Subramanian, Charles Nutter and many others. You can see the full list of the top influencers [here](https://jaxlondon.com/blog/java-core-languages/top-20-java-influencers-of-2018/).

I'll definitely continue to advocate for Java (and Apache Groovy) developers around the world, and share whatever I learn along the way through articles or conference talks. I'm looking forward to meeting you, my fellow Java/Groovy developer friends, at an event near you.
