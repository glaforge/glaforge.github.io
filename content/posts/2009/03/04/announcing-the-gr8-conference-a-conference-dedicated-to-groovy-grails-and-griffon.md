I'm pleased to announce here the organization of a European conference dedicated to Groovy, Grails and Griffon:GR8 Conference — Copenhagen — May 2009  

The **GR8 Conference** is an affordable two-day conference taking place in [Copenhagen, Denmark](http://www.gr8conf.org/location.gsp), on [May 18th and 19th 2009](http://www.gr8conf.org/agenda.gsp), organized by [Javagruppen](http://www.javagruppen.dk/)(Danish JUG) and [SpringSource](http://www.springsource.com/g2one), dedicated to the **Groovy** dynamic language, the **Grails** web framework, the **Griffon** Swing framework, and other great technologies — hence the pun and code name GR8.
