That's Devoxx France this week, and I've had the pleasure of delivering today anotherÂ [talk on the theme of chatbots, using Cloud Functions for the business logic, API.AI for the bot cleverness](https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2017/talk/NSJ-9765/Un_bot_pour_gerer_l'agenda_de_ta_conference), with a bonus of a demo through Google Home and the Google Assistant platform.

I'll post the YouTube video recording once it's online, but in the meantime, I wanted to share my slides here:
