The Java Champions recently nominated me to become a Java Champion!

{{< x user="java_champions" id="933194279412891648" >}}

There's also a [post](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/new-java-champions-in-2017) on the Java Champions' blog, and [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/01/JavaChampions2017) also echoed the new nominees recently.

I'm super happy and proud of this nomination, and I'm looking forward to continuing being involved in the Java ecosystem, present at Java-friendly conferences, contribute to Open Source projects using Java and Apache Groovy, and write articles here and there using my favorite languages.
