The [GR8Conf](http://eu.gr8conf.org/eu2010/) is back! A conference dedicated to [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/), [Grails](http://grails.org/), [Griffon](http://griffon.codehaus.org/), [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/), [Spock](http://www.spockframework.org/) and more! This second edition of the conference [takes place in Copehagen, Denmark](http://eu.gr8conf.org/eu2010/information/show/4), again like last year. And it's solely **dedicated to the Groovy Ecosystem**, and all the _GR8_ technologies based on it.

Over [two days, in a single track](http://eu.gr8conf.org/eu2010/agenda/index) (to avoid missing important sessions because of too much choice), you'll hear about:

*   the **Groovy** dynamic language for the JVM
*   the **Grails** web application stack based on Spring, Tomcat and Hibernate
*   the **Griffon** swing application framework for rich desktop applications
*   the **[Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/)** lightweight toolkit for easily developing and deploying small applications to Google App Engine
*   the **Gradle** build solution system
*   the **GPars** parallel library for Groovy

And some advanced talk on:

*   how to use Grails for the mobile web
*   how Grails works under the hood
*   how we're working on Groovy's core system
*   how to do advanced meta-programming with Groovy
*   how to use IntelliJ IDEA to develop with those GR8 technologies

There will also be a pretty interesting case study, on how European Patent Office has leveraged the Groovy dynamic language on its platform, showing once again how Groovy is used for serious enterprise work.

As the [agenda](http://eu.gr8conf.org/eu2010/agenda/index) there's a lot of very rich content for everybody on all those projects, and all those presentations are done by the [makers, leaders and experts](http://eu.gr8conf.org/eu2010/speaker/list) of these projects themselves! To name a few of the [speakers](http://eu.gr8conf.org/eu2010/speaker/list):

*   **Jochen Theodorou** - Groovy Tech Lead
*   **Graeme Rocher** - Grails Project Lead
*   **Andres Almiray** - Griffon project lead
*   **Sébastien Blanc** - Developer of a mobile Grails plugin
*   **Hubert K. Ikkink** (Mr. HaKi) - the famous G&G blogger with tons of great tips
*   **Hamlet D'Arcy** - Groovy committer
*   **Hans Dokter** - the founder of Gradle
*   **Vaclav Pech** - lead of the GPars project
