The Groovy development team and [SpringSource](http://www.springsource.com/) are very pleased to announce the **final release of Groovy 1.7**, the most popular and successful dynamic language for the JVM! After two betas and two release candidates, we're are happy to deliver this new and very important milestone to our ever growing user base.

Over the years, the Groovy project has managed to grow a community, but not only that, a **very rich and active ecosystem** of Groovy-related projects: the[Grails](http://grails.org/) web stack, the [Griffon](http://griffon.codehaus.org/) swing application framework, the [Gant](http://gant.codehaus.org/) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) build solutions, the [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/) lightweight toolkit for Google App Engine, the [Gpars](http://gpars.codehaus.org/)parallel system, the [Easyb](http://easyb.org/) and [Spock](http://www.spockframework.org/) testing frameworks and the [GMock](http://gmock.org/) mocking library, the [CodeNarc](http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/) and [GMetrics](http://gmetrics.sourceforge.net/) quality tools, and many more! With all these initiatives, the world is even groovier and we're thankful these projects have helped us shape what Groovy is today.

Groovy 1.7 provides the following new major features and enhancements:

*   **Anonymous Inner Classes** and **Nested Classes**, for more Java-friendliness
*   **Annotation enhancements**, with the ability to put annotations on imports, packages and variable declarations)
*   **Grape enhancement** (the Groovy module system)
*   **Power Asserts**, for more readable and expressive assertions
*   AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) enhancements with the **AST Viewer** and **AST Builder**, for easing the creation of AST transformations
*   Various dependency upgrades (including the ASM bytecode library to get ready for the JSR-292 InvokeDynamic bytecode instructions)
*   A **rewrite of the GroovyScriptEngine** for more flexibility and rapidity
*   Several **GroovyConsole enhancements**, like line numbers, a new output view, and more
*   Various **SQL improvements**, like batch updates and transaction support
*   and many more enhancements!
