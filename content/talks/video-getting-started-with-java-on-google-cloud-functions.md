For the 24 hours of talks by Google Cloud DevRel, I recorded my talk about the new Java 11 runtime for Google Cloud Functions. 
I wrote about this runtime in this [article](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/deploying-serverless-functions-in-groovy-on-the-new-java-11-runtime-for-google-cloud-functions) 
showing for example how to run [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) functions, and I also wrote about it on the 
[GCP blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/introducing-java-11-on-google-cloud-functions) 
and [Google Developers blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/05/java-11-for-cloud-functions.html) as well.

In this video, I'm giving a quick explanations on the serverless approach, the various serverless options provided by Google Cloud, 
and then I dive into the various shapes Java functions can take (HTTP and background functions), 
the interfaces you have to implement when authoring a function. 
And I also do various demonstrations, deploying Java functions, Groovy functions, or Micronaut functions!
