It's the conference season. After JavaOne, comes [SpringOne2GX](http://springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/home), in Chicago, this week (October 25th till 28th). Then [Greach](http://greach.es/) in Madrid (Spain), [Devoxx](http://devoxx.com/display/DV11/Home) in Antwerp (Belgium) and we'll finish with [Groovy/Grails eXchange](http://skillsmatter.com/event/java-jee/groovy-grails-exchange-2011) in London (UK).  

In Chicago this week, we'll have 4 tracks dedicated to Groovy, Grails, and the big Groovy ecosystem (Gradle, Griffon, Spock, Geb...) over three days. That's a lot of sessions and speakers ready to tell you all about what's rocking in our world!  

Be sure to check the [agenda](http://springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/2gx/event_sessions) and the nice line-up of [speakers](http://springone2gx.com/conference/chicago/2011/10/speakers).  

I'll be presenting three talks:

*   Groovy Update: What's new in Groovy 1.8 and what's coming
*   Groovy DSLs, from beginner to expert, with my friend Paul King, that'll be a new edition of our past year's talk
*   Gaelyk, Groovy coding to the cloud

I'm looking forward to meeting you all in Chicago!
