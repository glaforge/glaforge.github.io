[LOAF](http://postneo.com/postwiki/moin.cgi/LoafHome) is taking the community by storm. I do firmly believe it gonna rock the world. Social software is the way to go : the next revolution. But as far as I know there were no LOAF implementation in [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org), a promising programming language.

So let's see how simple it is to write a LOAF implementation using Groovy:

```groovy
class LOAF {
    static main(args) {
        def loaf = new LOAF()
    }
}
```

I'm a beginner in Groovy, so use at your own risk. Play with it, it's free as in beer !
