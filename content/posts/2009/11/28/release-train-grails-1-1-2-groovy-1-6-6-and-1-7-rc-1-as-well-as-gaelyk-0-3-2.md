Big release days!

*   Yesterday, [Grails 1.1.2](http://www.grails.org/1.1.2+Release+Notes) was pulled from the oven, while waiting for Spring 3 to be available to release 1.2.
*   Today, we [released Groovy 1.6.6 and 1.7-RC-1](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2009/11/27/Groovy+1.6.6+and+1.7-RC-1+released), bringing use closer to the final 1.7 release, which would take place before Christmas.
*   And tonight, I've also updated [Gaelyk 0.3.2](http://groups.google.com/group/gaelyk/browse_thread/thread/fe09f18440e3812d), the lightweight Groovy toolkit for developing applications on Google App Engine. In particular, have a look at the URL routing support and the few bug fixes and also at my [presentation at the Devoxx conference](http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=286).

Have fun and enjoy those releases!
