The article delves into the persistent challenge of real-time, concurrent collaborative document authoring, observing that most current offerings are primarily oriented towards an asynchronous mode of operation.

The author first outlines various existing methods for document collaboration, highlighting their asynchronous nature. Microsoft Word, for instance, allows for revisions, changes, and highlighting, but does not support true simultaneous editing. The "good old email system" is described as a "ping-pong way" of exchanging documents, explicitly disallowing concurrent modifications. Versioning systems like CVS or Subversion enable parallel editing of document copies, but still necessitate a subsequent merging process, thus falling short of real-time co-authoring.

The discussion then shifts to tools that *do* offer some degree of real-time functionality. SubEthaEdit is presented as a notable example for Mac users, which makes real-time modifications possible on the same document. However, the author expresses curiosity about its performance over the internet versus local Wi-Fi connections, and crucially, notes the apparent absence of a comparable real-time collaborative application for Windows users. Jeremy Rayner's Java application, NetPad, is introduced as another attempt to provide real-time capabilities. Yet, the author recounts a trial of NetPad over the internet that was "not yet ideal," encountering issues such as network timeouts and problems with content synchronization when buffers differed.

The article then moves to a specific use case that prompted the author's reflection on collaboration tools. The author and Jeremy Rayner needed to work together on a document in preparation for a Groovy's JSR Expert Group and Groovy developers meeting in London. Following their unsuccessful attempt to use NetPad for this purpose, they devised a "mixed approach" to achieve near real-time collaboration: chatting on IRC (Internet Relay Chat) while simultaneously using a simple Wiki application called Biscuit Barrel.

Biscuit Barrel is detailed as an "incredible simple and light Wiki application." It leverages Groovy scripting and Radeox wiki-markup rendering, a technology associated with SnipSnap and Confluence. The author praises Biscuit Barrel's features, including the ability to write dynamic macros, create dynamic pages and templates, and integrate SiteMesh, drawing a comparison to professional wikis like the powerful GPL XWiki. While acknowledging that Biscuit is not a "prime-time or scalable Wiki," it is commended for being "pretty neat and snappy to use on your localhost, or within an intranet."

The crux of their successful collaborative strategy lay in the integration of IRC. They used IRC not just for communication, but critically, to manage an "editing token." This meant that only one person held the "editing" token at a time, allowing them to modify the Biscuit page. Once that person was "done," they would signal on IRC, effectively passing the token to the other individual, who could then take their turn editing. This "simple solution for a complex system" allowed them to work in a close-to-real-time manner.

The author concludes that this method – combining brainstorming via IRC with note-taking on a Wiki – resulted in a "very productive and entertaining session." The key takeaway is that for "near real-time collaboration on a document, it can be as simple as using IRC+Wiki." The article closes with an open invitation to readers, asking for tips, software recommendations, or any alternative solutions for real-time collaborative authoring, expressing a strong desire for a better existing solution or the potential necessity of creating one in the future.
