[IntelliJ IDEA 4.0](http://www.intellij.com/) is not yet out of its Early Access Program phase that a [discussion](http://www.intellij.net/forums/thread.jsp?forum=22&thread=63081) already started in the forums for the code name of the next EAP cycle.

There are already a few propositions for the next code name. Among them:

*   **StarGate** (hmm, not that good)
*   **Avani** (which means earth in some indian languages)
*   **Stella** (which will not be used because it was already used for IDEA 2.0 for those who remember)
*   **Avalon** (already used by Microsoft's new UI framework, and the Apache Avalon framework)
*   **Rhea** (suggested internally at JetBrains by [Eugene Belyaev](http://www.eugenebelyaev.com/begblog/))
*   **Aardvark** (maybe too harsh to pronounce)
*   **Atlantis** (mythological sunken island)
*   **Athena** (greek goddess)
*   **Lachesis**, **Clotho** or **Athropos** (the three moirae)
*   **Ananke** (necessity), **Erebus**
*   **Vedra** (as in Vedra Valles)
*   **Miranda** (that's my suggestion, already used by Miranda-IM, and it [reminds something to outlaws in the US](http://glaforge.free.fr/weblog/index.php?itemid=58))
*   **Olesya** (CVS integration developer), **Katja** or **Laika** (first female dog in space)
*   Derivations of Simple (**Simplex**, **Simplicity**, **SimpleA**...)
*   **Dione** (another Greek goddess)
*   **Aphrodite**, **Athena**, **Adonis** (to stick with "A" and the Greek mythology)
*   **Artemida** (tiger hunter... JDK 1.5 hunter)
*   **Archimedes** (another sinking idea...)
*   **Revolution** (somewhat related to the Aurora cruiser)
*   **Banana** (quite funny one)
*   **Donut** (for hungry developers)

I like Miranda, of course, because that's my suggestion, but I also like Rhea and Ananke, they sound good to my ears. What would you suggest ?
