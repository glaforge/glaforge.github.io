This week’s edition of Groovy Weekly is a bit peculiar, as the big news of the week is [Pivotal’s announcement that it will stop funding the Groovy and Grails](http://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal/news-2/groovy-2-4-and-grails-3-0-to-be-last-major-releases-under-pivotal-sponsorship) projects.

As a result those popular Open Source projects are now seeking a new home!

You can read [Guillaume Laforge’s](http://glaforge.appspot.com/article/the-groovy-project-is-looking-for-a-new-home) and [Graeme Rocher’s](http://grails.io/post/108534902333/the-future-of-groovy-grails-sponsorship) announcements to hear a bit more about the story. And if your company is interested in further funding the projects, please don’t hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:sponsorship@groovy-lang.org)!
