This article is a personal anecdote detailing the author's severe allergic reaction to horsefly bites. The author begins by expressing a strong dislike for horseflies ("taons"), labeling them "really nasty critters," primarily because of a personal allergy to their bites.

The incident occurred while the author was in the rural countryside of Alsace, accompanying his girlfriend during her scientific experiments. This particular area was abundant with horseflies. During this time, the author was bitten twice, once on each hand.

Within a few hours of the bites, the allergic reaction manifested dramatically: the author's hands "literally doubled in size." The swelling was so severe that during a subsequent excursion to Europa-Park in Germany, the author had to seek medical assistance. A Red Cross nurse at the park bandaged both hands to manage the swelling and discomfort. The article notes that a photograph of these bandaged hands was provided as evidence.

Upon returning to Strasbourg, the author and his girlfriend contacted a doctor. The doctor administered a cortisone injection and prescribed appropriate medication to treat the allergic reaction. Another photograph was included in the original article, depicting the author's hands after the bandages were removed, still significantly swollen, which the author describes as "impressive."

In conclusion, the article serves as a vivid personal account of the discomfort and severity of an allergic reaction to horsefly bites, highlighting the rapid onset of extreme swelling and the necessity of medical intervention, from bandaging by a nurse to a doctor's cortisone treatment and medication. The author's main point is to underscore the unpleasantness and potential seriousness of horsefly encounters, especially for those with allergies.
