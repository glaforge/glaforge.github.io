The Groovy development team is really pleased and proud to announce the release of the **final version of Groovy 1.8.0**!

After a lot of work and efforts throughout four betas and four release candidates, version 1.8 of Groovy has been long in the making, but is packed with **tons of new features and enhancements**, for your productivity, and your pleasure. In particular, you'll be happy to learn about:

*   the new [Domain-Specific Language authoring capabilities](http://bit.ly/groovy-18#Groovy1.8releasenotes-CommandchainsfornicerDomainSpecificLanguages) for more readability and expressivity of your business rules,
*   the [runtime performance improvements](http://bit.ly/groovy-18#Groovy1.8releasenotes-Performanceimprovements),
*   the [bundling of the GPars parallel and concurrency library](http://bit.ly/groovy-18#Groovy1.8releasenotes-GParsbundledwithintheGroovydistribution),
*   the [built-in JSON support](http://bit.ly/groovy-18#Groovy1.8releasenotes-NativeJSONsupport),
*   the new [compile-time meta-programming features](http://bit.ly/groovy-18#Groovy1.8releasenotes-NewASTTransformations) (several new useful AST transformations),
*   the new [functional programming aspects of closures](http://bit.ly/groovy-18#Groovy1.8releasenotes-Closureenhancements),
*   and much more.

To get all the details, with code samples, we have prepared an in-depth [release notes](http://bit.ly/groovy-18) document. Please have a look at it to learn more about the features listed above, and discover other smaller enhancements as well.

You can download Groovy 1.8 in our [JIRA tickets](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download%3Edownload%20section%3C/a%3E%C2%A0and%20you%20can%20have%20a%20look%20at%20the%20list%20of%20%3Ca%20href=) that have found their way into this major release.

We'd like to thank all those who participated and contributed to this release: users, contributors, committers, framework writers, IDE developers, book authors. Without you all, Groovy wouldn't be the great productive language it is now. And again, without you all, Groovy wouldn't be surrounded by its **vibrant, active and rich ecosystem**, giving you advanced tools and frameworks for building web applications ([Grails](http://grails.org/), [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/)) or rich desktop applications ([Griffon](http://griffon.codehaus.org/)), for building your own projects ([Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/)), for testing your projects ([Spock](http://spockframework.org/), [Geb](http://geb.codehaus.org/)), for tackling the concurrency and parallel problems on our multi-core / multi-processor architectures ([GPars](http://gpars.codehaus.org/)), or for improving the quality of your Groovy code bases ([CodeNarc](http://codenarc.sourceforge.net/) for static code analysis, [GContracts](https://github.com/andresteingress/gcontracts/wiki/) for design by contract).

Enjoy this release!
