This article serves as a reflective summary of the author's first year as a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud, marking their "Googleversary." The author joined Google Cloud in June of the previous year and describes the journey as a significant "ride."

Throughout their inaugural year, the author engaged in a wide array of activities demonstrating their active role in the developer community and within Google Cloud. Quantitatively, they spoke at over 20 conferences or meetups, delivered 3 keynotes, and authored a substantial 36 articles. Furthermore, they met with approximately a dozen customers and directly addressed literally thousands of developers. The author provided specific examples of their extensive speaking engagements, such as presenting 5 times at Devoxx Belgium and conducting 6 talks or workshops during a trip to Singapore.

A key theme highlighted in the article is the "great level of freedom" inherent in the Developer Advocate role. The author expresses appreciation for the autonomy to decide on travel commitments and to choose the specific topics and products to cover, describing this aspect of the job as "really wonderful."

The article details the diverse range of Google Cloud technologies and services the author has focused on during this period. On the compute side, their work included Google App Engine (a product they have been a fan of since 2009), Kubernetes and Container Engine, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Endpoints for Web API aspects. From the Big Data and Machine Learning perspective, the author discussed various Machine Learning APIs, encompassing Vision, Speech recognition, Natural Language processing, and Video intelligence. They also utilized BigQuery for analyzing datasets like the Github repository data. More recently, the author's work has emphasized the popular combination of chatbots and serverless architectures, specifically using API.AI and Cloud Functions to build conversational interfaces, which has become a significant hit at conferences and meetups.

Despite the extensive work already undertaken, the author conveys a deep passion and eagerness to explore even more technologies, noting there are "just so many hours in a day, and there's so much more I want to work on and play with!" To illustrate this enthusiasm, the author uses an evocative analogy: working as a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud is akin to "being a kid entering a toy store where you'd be told: 'hey, here are all the toys we have, feel free to play with everything you want!'" This analogy is extended to emphasize the collaborative aspect, likening it to playing with "other kids (err, sorry, fellow DAs) on all those things, to imagine the next epic game together!"

The article concludes with a forward-looking statement, where the author expresses eagerness to continue sharing information about Google Cloud and invites readers and developers to connect and chat at upcoming conferences or meetups.
