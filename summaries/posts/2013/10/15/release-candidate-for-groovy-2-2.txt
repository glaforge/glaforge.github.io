The Groovy programming language team recently announced two significant releases: the release candidate for Groovy 2.2 (Groovy 2.2.0-rc-1) and a bug-fix release for Groovy 2.1 (Groovy 2.1.8). The announcement, disseminated across various communication channels, highlighted key changes and called for community engagement, especially regarding the upcoming Groovy 2.2 final release.

The primary message regarding Groovy 2.2 Release Candidate is that the final version is "fast approaching." The Groovy team is actively seeking as much feedback as possible on this release candidate to "squash potential bugs" before its general availability. Users are strongly encouraged to test their applications thoroughly with Groovy 2.2.0-rc-1 to contribute to its stability.

A notable update, applicable to both Groovy 2.2 Release Candidate and Groovy 2.1.8, concerns the default configuration for the `@Grab` dependency management system. The Groovy team has made a "small update" to this configuration by setting Bintray's JCenter repository as the first in the chain of resolvers. This decision was based on several advantages JCenter offers over Maven Central: it is "noticeably faster and more responsive," consistently provides dependencies with their checksums, and stores and caches dependencies it wouldn't otherwise have, leading to faster delivery for subsequent requests. This change is expected to significantly improve the performance of scripts relying on `@Grab` when downloading dependencies for the first time.

Beyond the shared configuration update, Groovy 2.2 Release Candidate introduces specific new features, primarily implemented as AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformations.

One of the interesting new capabilities in Groovy 2.2 is the ability for scripts to define their own base script class. Traditionally, all Groovy scripts implicitly extend the `groovy.lang.Script` abstract class. While it was previously possible to customize this base class through `CompilerConfiguration`, Groovy 2.2 simplifies this process with a new AST transformation. This allows developers to declare a custom base script class directly within the script using the `@BaseScript` annotation. For example, a script can define an `abstract class DeclaredBaseScript extends Script` and then use `@BaseScript DeclaredBaseScript baseScript` to make properties or methods defined in `DeclaredBaseScript` directly accessible within the script itself, such as `assert meaningOfLife == 42` if `meaningOfLife = 42` was defined in the base class.

Another significant addition to Groovy 2.2 is a new variant of the `@Log` AST transformation, specifically designed to support Log4j2. The new `@Log4j2` transformation provides a streamlined way to integrate Log4j2 logging into Groovy classes. This allows developers to easily inject a `log` instance into their classes and utilize standard Log4j2 logging methods, as demonstrated by `@Log4j2 class MyClass { void doSomething() { log.info "did something groovy today!" } }`.

For more in-depth details regarding the changes, bug fixes, and improvements in both releases, users are directed to the respective JIRA release notes: one for Groovy 2.1.8 and another for Groovy 2.2.0-rc-1. Both Groovy 2.1.8 and Groovy 2.2.0-rc-1 are immediately available for download from the official Groovy download area.

The announcement concluded with a sincere thank you to all contributors who played a vital role in these releases through their bug reports, active discussions on mailing lists, and direct code contributions and pull requests.
