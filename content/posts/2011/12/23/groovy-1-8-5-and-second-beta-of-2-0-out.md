The Groovy development team has just announced a joint release of Groovy 1.8.5 and a second beta of the upcoming 2.0 release.  
We'd be happy to hear your feedback on the static type checking support and the experimental static compilation as well.  
Here's the [official announcement](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2011/12/23/Groovy+1.8.5+and+2.0-beta-2+released):

> The Groovy development team is happy to deliver two new releases as early Christmas presents: Groovy 1.8.5 and 2.0-beta-2.  
>   
> While we work hard on Invoke Dynamic support, Static Type Checking and some experimental static compilation, we also find time to fix a good load of bugs and some minor improvements, as those two releases here are essentially minor incremental versions.  
>   
> You can have a look at the tickets closed here, for 1.8.5:

> On behalf of the Groovy development team, we'd like to wish you a Groovy Christmas and a very Happy New Year.
