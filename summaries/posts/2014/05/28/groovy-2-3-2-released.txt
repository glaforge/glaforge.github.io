The Groovy team has officially announced the release of Groovy 2.3.2, which is a critical bug fix release within their 2.3 main development branch. This update is not merely a routine patch but addresses a significant issue that affects the integrity of compiled code.

A core message from the Groovy team is a strong recommendation for all users who have already migrated to the Groovy 2.3 series to upgrade to version 2.3.2 without delay. The urgency stems from a severe flaw present in the two preceding 2.3 releases, specifically Groovy 2.3.0 and Groovy 2.3.1. These earlier versions incorporated a buggy iteration of the ASM library, which is a crucial component responsible for bytecode generation.

The critical defect caused by this faulty ASM version was its incorrect generation of bytecode for inner classes. This means that any Groovy code compiled using Groovy 2.3.0 or 2.3.1 that incorporates inner classes is highly likely to contain erroneous, or "faulty," bytecode. Such faulty bytecode can lead to unexpected runtime behavior, crashes, or other unpredictable issues in applications.

Given the potential for corrupted compiled artifacts, the Groovy team has issued a stern directive: users *must* recompile all their existing code with Groovy 2.3.2 if it was previously compiled with 2.3.0 or 2.3.1 and utilizes inner classes. This recompilation step is essential to ensure that the generated bytecode is correct and stable.

For those seeking more technical details regarding the specific issue, a link to the JIRA ticket GROOVY-6808 has been provided. Additionally, a comprehensive JIRA change log detailing all modifications and fixes introduced in Groovy 2.3.2 is available. Users can download the new Groovy 2.3.2 release from the official Groovy website. The announcement concludes by extending gratitude to all contributors who helped make this release possible.
