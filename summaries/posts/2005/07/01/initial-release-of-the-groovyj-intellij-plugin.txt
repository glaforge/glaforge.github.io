This article announces the significant release of the initial version of GroovyJ, a new IntelliJ IDEA plugin designed to seamlessly integrate the Groovy programming language into the popular integrated development environment.

The plugin was developed and announced by Franck Rasolo, described as an IntelliJ expert, on behalf of the Groovy team. This marks the first public release of GroovyJ, aiming to provide robust support for Groovy developers working within the IntelliJ IDEA ecosystem. For those interested in a more comprehensive list of features, the announcement directs readers to a dedicated GroovyJ status page.

The core functionalities shipped with this initial release are designed to streamline several key aspects of Groovy development within IntelliJ IDEA. These features include:

1.  **Automatic Groovy Runtime Installation:** GroovyJ simplifies project setup by automatically installing a default Groovy runtime. This runtime is configured as a global library, making it readily available for use across various projects within the IDE without manual configuration.
2.  **Syntax Highlighting for Groovy Files:** To enhance code readability and development efficiency, the plugin provides a certain level of syntax highlighting for Groovy files. This feature helps developers quickly distinguish different elements of the Groovy language, such as keywords, strings, comments, and variables.
3.  **Creation of 'Run Configurations' for Groovy Scripts:** Developers gain the ability to create dedicated 'Run Configurations' for runnable Groovy scripts. This functionality allows for easy setup and management of script execution parameters, improving the workflow for testing and running Groovy code.
4.  **Execution of Groovy Scripts with Console Output:** The plugin enables users to execute Groovy scripts directly from IntelliJ IDEA. The output generated by these scripts is conveniently captured and displayed within the IDE's embedded console window, providing immediate feedback during development.
5.  **Automatic Compilation of Groovy Scripts:** For projects where Groovy scripts are an integral part of the codebase, GroovyJ ensures that scripts located within module source or test folders are automatically compiled. This compilation occurs seamlessly whenever the containing modules are compiled, integrating Groovy into the standard build process.

The article also specifies practical details for users wishing to install the plugin. GroovyJ is conveniently available through IntelliJ IDEA's built-in plug-in manager, simplifying its discovery and installation process. It also has a specific system requirement, necessitating IntelliJ IDEA version 5.0 build #3378 or higher to function correctly.
