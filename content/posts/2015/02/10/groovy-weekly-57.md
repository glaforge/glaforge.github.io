So what’s Groovy this week? The Groovy community is still celebrating the 4.5+ million downloads of Groovy last year, is drive testing the upcoming Gradle 2.3, while Greach is announcing its impressive roster of speakers.

  

But there’s an item of news dear to my heart this week, with the “go to production” message from Dierk about Groovy in Action, second edition! Many times the book has been revised to catch up with the latest and greatest of Groovy, and this new edition will bring you up-to-date with Groovy 2.4, so you can expect the official print and e-book final versions imminently!
